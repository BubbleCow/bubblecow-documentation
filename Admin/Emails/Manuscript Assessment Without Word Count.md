Hi.

I appreciate your interest and am eager to explore the prospect of collaborating with you on the publication of your book.

**SOMETHING ABOUT THE BOOK**

Before we delve into specific details...

To accurately determine the cost for editing your manuscript, I will need the total word count. Our pricing is a flat fee that's calculated based on this count, and it's inclusive of all our services. 

Here's the free cost calculator: https://bubblecow.com/manuscript-assessment#item-price-calculator

Every author's needs are unique, so I thought it necessary to provide you with a comprehensive outline of what our service includes. You can find these details at: https://bubblecow.com/manuscript-assessment and https://bubblecow.com/terms-and-conditions

To help you better comprehend our process, I've attached a sample report (shared with the author's consent).

If you wish, we can also provide a non-disclosure agreement for your peace of mind.

Once we have addressed all these points, and if you have any questions or wish to discuss further before moving ahead, do not hesitate to reach out. I would be more than happy to arrange a conversation.

Kindly provide me with the word count so we can proceed to the next step in this exciting journey.

Gary Smailes
