This document outlines the standard screenplay format.
## Standard screenplay format?
Screenplay format is relatively simple, but it’s one of those things that can seem a bit daunting until you’ve actually learned how to do it.

The basics of script formatting are as follows:

- 12-point Courier font size
- 1.5 inch margin on the left of the page
- 1 inch margin on the right of the page
-  1 inch on the of the top and bottom of the page
- Each page should have approximately 55 lines
- The dialogue block starts 2.5 inches from the left side of the page
- Character names must have uppercase letters and be positioned starting 3.7 inches from the left side of the page
- Page numbers are positioned in the top right corner with a 0.5 inch margin from the top of the page. The first page shall not be numbered, and each number is followed by a period.

### Scene Heading
The scene heading is there to help break up physical spaces and give the reader and production team an idea of the story’s geography.

You will either choose _INT._ for interior spaces or _EXT._ for exterior spaces. Then a _description of the setting_, and then the _time of day_. 

Here’s a screenplay example for external:

EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT
We open in a modern suburban home. The front window illuminated from the lights within. We see a silhouette of the occupant.  

Here’s a screenplay example for internal:

INT. EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT
FILBERT (9), wiry, lost in his own imaginary world. Dressed as a knight. A toy sword in his hand. 

#### SUBHEADING
Often, writers will use subheadings to show a change in location without breaking the scene, even if the scene has shifted from _INT._ to _EXT._  
  
Here’s a script example:

INT. EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT
FILBERT (9), wiry, lost in his own imaginary world. Dressed as a knight. A toy sword in his hand. 

HALLWAY
Filbert comes around the corner, distracted by his fantasy world, bumps into the wall. His sword slips from his hand.
