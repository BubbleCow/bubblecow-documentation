This document outlines the standard screenplay format.
## Standard screenplay format?
Screenplay format is relatively simple, but it’s one of those things that can seem a bit daunting until you’ve actually learned how to do it.

The basics of script formatting are as follows:

- 12-point Courier font size
- 1.5 inch margin on the left of the page
- 1 inch margin on the right of the page
-  1 inch on the of the top and bottom of the page
- Each page should have approximately 55 lines
- The dialogue block starts 2.5 inches from the left side of the page
- Character names must have uppercase letters and be positioned starting 3.7 inches from the left side of the page
- Page numbers are positioned in the top right corner with a 0.5 inch margin from the top of the page. The first page shall not be numbered, and each number is followed by a period.

### Scene Heading
The scene heading is there to help break up physical spaces and give the reader and production team an idea of the story’s geography.

You will either choose _INT._ for interior spaces or _EXT._ for exterior spaces. Then a _description of the setting_, and then the _time of day_. 

Here’s a screenplay example for external:

EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT
We open in a modern suburban home. The front window illuminated from the lights within. We see a silhouette of the occupant.  

Here’s a screenplay example for internal:

INT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT
FILBERT (9), wiry, lost in his own imaginary world. Dressed as a knight. A toy sword in his hand. 

### Subheading
Often, writers will use subheadings to show a change in location without breaking the scene, even if the scene has shifted from _INT._ to _EXT._  

It is assumed that readers will understand the change in space while retaining the idea that the time of day is the same - even continuous.

The reason many writers do this is to avoid the notion that we’ve entered an entirely new scene, though you could always include CONTINUOUS in place of _DAY_ or _NIGHT_ by creating an entirely new scene heading.

It’s a matter of personal style and rhythm vs. production considerations.
  
Here’s a script example:

INT. EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT
FILBERT (9), wiry, lost in his own imaginary world. Dressed as a knight. A toy sword in his hand. 

HALLWAY
Filbert comes around the corner, distracted by his fantasy world, bumps into the wall. His sword slips from his hand.  

### Transitions
In the bottom right of the page you will place transitions, but in modern screenwriting these seem to be used less and less. The transitions that seems to have really stood the test of time are _CUT TO:_ and _FADE OUT._

You may also include something like _DISSOLVE TO:_, but these are used less and less, probably for the same reason you avoid camera shots.

Here’s a screenplay example:

EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT
We open in a modern suburban home. The front window illuminated from the lights within. We see a silhouette of the occupant.  

CUT TO:

INT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT
FILBERT (9), wiry, lost in his own imaginary world. Dressed as a knight. A toy sword in his hand. 
#### Character Introductions
When you introduce a character in a screenplay, you want to use all-capital letters for the name of the character, then a reference to their age, and finally some information about their traits and personality.

Again, screenwriters have found other ways to do this, but this is the most common and production friendly way to introduce a character. 

We have a post on how to introduce characters in a screenplay that goes into the creative considerations of introducing characters, so I highly recommend you check it out after this post to learn more.

Here’s a screenplay example:

INT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

FILBERT (9), wiry, lost in his own imaginary world. Dressed as a knight. A toy sword in his hand. 
### Action
Action lines are where you describe the visual and audible actions that take place on screen. You want to write in third person in present tense.

Often, you can make your script a better read by eliminating redundant pronouns and conjunctions. Big sounds and important objects can be written out in ALL CAPS to emphasize their effect on the story.

Here’s a screenplay example:

INT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT
He stares into the abyss. Sweat drips down his defeated face. Mouth agape. Hands clenched. WE HEAR a resounding THUD. Filbert takes a deep breath. 
### Dialogue
Your lines of dialogue will be set underneath the character to which they are assigned. Dialogue is pretty straightforward from a formatting standpoint, but it is the most difficult part of screenwriting.

If you want to learn more, check out our post on _22 Screenwriting Tips for Writing Better Dialogue_ where I go over a bunch of ways to audit your screenplay for good… and bad dialogue.

Here’s a screenplay example:

INT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

FILBERT
This is my castle, I have shown to protect it.

### Extensions
These occur when a character says something off-screen _(O.S.)__,_ or if dialogue is voice-over _(V.O.)__._ You will see extensions when a character ends a block of dialogue, performs an action, and speaks more.

This takes the form of continued (CONT’D). Professional script writing software will help you with this, but it will not be able to predict when you want something said off screen or in voice-over.

Here’s a screenplay example:

INT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

NARRATOR (V.O.)
Filbert had sworn to protect his castle. 

### Parenthetical 
You can use a parenthetical inside your dialogue to show small actions, or even a change in mood without having to jump out to an action line.

Parentheticals are really good for directing actors, and adding sarcasm and nuance to performances on the page, but you may want to be cautious about adding them too much. Actors are professionals, and if Al Pacino finds parentheticals in a script, he may get his feelings hurt.

Here’s a screenplay example:

INT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

FILBERT
(into the phone)
This is my castle, I have shown to protect it.
### Camera Shots
The best professional screenwriters know how to suggest shots without actually writing in shots, but if you really insist on describing a particular shot in your screenplay you can format it like a subheading.

This lets us know that the shot is supposed to be set so that we see things from Filbert’s perspective. Writing out shots is often frowned upon, but if you’re directing the film, maybe do it sparingly.

Here’s a script example:

INT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Filbert stares into the abyss. Sweat drips down his defeated face. Mouth agape. Hands clenched. WE HEAR a resounding THUD. Filbert takes a deep breath.
