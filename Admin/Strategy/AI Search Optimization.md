This is early data (March 2024) prior to roll out but Seems like it will be focused on searches for questions such 'how to' etc,. Also for some product related searches, such as 'best watch for runners'. It also appears to factor in the local element to this search, so 'best bars in Liverpool'. 

The generated result has a big block of AI generated text on the left (Gemini) with the option to chat.

There seem to be four ways to benefit and still rank:

1. **Link carousel** on the right hand side. This is three links by default, but more if you scroll.
2. **Drop down links** appear after each AI generated statement. These seem to be the same format as the carousel links. 
3. **Indirect Product or service recommendation** is important since the AI will suggest products and services via links.
4. **Direct Product or service recommendation** sees AI reference your product, service or business as an answer.
## How to Rank
There is no predictable way to rank in AI results yet, but an number of factors seem important. 

- **Rank well in traditional search** - Not essential but it seems that ranking well is an advantage, especially if your are showing in things like snippets. Solid traditional SEO factors are important for AI search. 
- **Create precisely focused content** - It seems that content that directly answers a user question is much more likely to rank. So, for example, if the search term was 'best watch for runners', a post answering this question directly is more likely to rank than one that is more general ('best sports watch') even if it is generating higher traffic. The are being called Exact Match Blogs (EMB).
- **Create bite sized snippets** - These are 250-300 character summaries of exact search term, written in a way that is simple and easy to read. Ideally these will be added to the top of a blog post. It seems that if the information is more higher up the page their is more chance of ranking number one on the carousel. Evidence suggests that this is also helping rank in Bing's AI system.
