This is early data (March 2024) prior to roll out but Seems like it will be focused on searches for questions such 'how to' etc,. Also for some product related searches, such as 'best watch for runners'. It also appears to factor in the local element to this search, so 'best bars in Liverpool'. 

The generated result has a big block of AI generated text on the left (Gemini) with the option to chat.

There seem to be four ways to benefit and still rank:

1. **Link carousel** on the right hand side. This is three links by default, but more if you scroll.
2. **Drop down links** appear after each AI generated statement. These seem to be the same format as the carousel links. 
3. **Product or service recommendation** is important since the AI will suggest products and services.
