>  This section is the detailed outline for the re-imaging of BubbleCow and how I feel things will change in the future.

In the past, BubbleCow has been a single product service (developmental editing) relying on SEO to appear in the writers eye-line at point of service research. To date this has worked, but it is now under threat for several reasons, with the impact of AI being the most important.
## AI Improvements in Service
TLDR: **AI will reduce the number of people using developmental editors**. 

The use of AI generated reports will mean that editors will be able to produce feedback quickly and cheaply. The cost of these reports will be the price of the AI call plus, potentially, the some human input. This means reports can be generated for pennies. We may even see these services integrated at the point of writing (think Grammalry).

This will mean that editorial feedback will become a commodity. Though this feedback might not be as good (initially), it will still be good enough and cheap enough to outweigh this problem. We will see writers paying a relatively small amounts for feedback that will significantly improve their writing. This will not kill the editor generated reports completely, and we will still see a group of writers willing to pay £1500+ for a professional human edit. However, this number will drastically reduce. 

The result will be a further fragmentation of the market. I predict we will see Reedy go bust or pivot, at least one or two editorial suppliers disappear, and large number of freelancers drop from the marketplace.  
## AI Reduced Traffic
TLDR: **AI generated search results will reduce traffic**. 

Google are looking to use AI to answer certain types of questions at the point of search. This will result in them delivering answering via the Gemini LLM, with the added ability to 'chat' for a more detailed response. 

This logical and powerful approach will transform 'search'. Though there will be opportunists to benefit from this AI system, the immediate impact will be a significant, and unavoidable, drop in traffic to sites across the Internet. 

This will most remove 'casual' and non-intentioned traffic from sites. Though this will have a major impact on the traffic to a site, it could well be the case that though sites are getting less traffic, it is a of higher qaulity with better conversion. 

This means that SEO strategy, solid conversion practices and well designed websites become increasingly important. 
## Impact of Changes
I am, therefore, predicting several outcomes from AI driven changes to editorial services and website traffic.

- **Better books** - Low cost access to AI editorial tools will mean that the general quality of books will improve. Writers will be able to receive better and cheaper editorial support, plus help with the way in which they write. It will shift the focus away from craft and towards story telling.  This will, in turn, result in better reviews and more readers. This boost in sales will be matched with a reduction in pre-production costs making self-publishing an increasingly viable option for writers. 
- **Change in writing services** - Increase in the quality of AI editorial services, together with a reduction in traffic to the website, will mean a huge drop in business for developmental editing and copy editing. We are going to see these service become commodities, which, in turn, will decimate the current business landscape. However, the boost in the viability of successful independent writer means we see new and different services flourishing.
- **Changes to industry** - We will see a huge change in the landscape for editorial services. It is hard to see how Reedsy will survive. A reduction in the price you can charge for editing, together with a drop in number of writers seeking editing, will kill them. We will also see a reduction in editorial business that relay on editorial services. I also feel that freelancers will drop away since it will become unprofitable for them to edit at increasingly lower prices. It is difficult to predict but I think it will leave a small number of freelances and one or two big businesses. 

The results of these changes will be catastrophic for BubbleCow's current business model. A reduction in traffic, with a change in customer buying habits means that profit will tumble as writers become less and services become first cheaper, and the obsolete. 

However, BubbleCow has three important foundations that suggest that though it can't survive in its current form, it can pivot to plat a role in the next iteration of independent writers.

- **Knowledge and Expertise** - BubbleCow's deep understanding of writers, what they need to create great books and how to make these books a success means they have the insight needed to change with the changing landscape. 
- **Reputation** - BubbleCow comes with fifteen plus years of solid reputation within the community. This will allow them to reposition and retain good will of writers. 
- **First Mover Advantage** - The fact BubbleCow see these problems so far in advance is a huge competitive advantage. There is currently no indication that any other competitor is making moves to survive. 
- **SEO** - Fifteen years of SEO means that BubbleCow have a robust marketing avenue that despite changes will form the foundation for a new direction. 
## New Direction
The editorial marketplace will be different from other markets in that the very service they offer will be transformed by AI. However, though AI will create tools it [will not change the 'shape' publishing landscape](https://longform.asmartbear.com/ai-startups/). In fact, AI will assist writers in creating better books. So rather then kill the independent writing space it will reinvigorate it.

This creates opportunity. 

The skill comes in understanding where this opportunity lies. In the past fifteen years the focus has been on craft. It has been operating in the space between a writer's ambitions and their ability. The writing marketplace has been teaching writers to write. This is no longer a futile hunting ground since AI will provide the tools needed for writers to lift their books to a publishable standard at little to no cost.  AI will help revolutionize systems. It will make complex and important tasks easy, cheap, and better. 

The opportunity now lies in the places where [AI can't operate](https://bigthink.com/the-future/what-ai-cannot-do/). 

1. **Creativity.** AI cannot create, conceptualize, or plan strategically. While AI is great at optimizing for a narrow objective, it is unable to choose its own goals or to think creatively. Nor can AI think across domains or apply common sense.
2. **Empathy.** AI cannot feel or interact with feelings like empathy and compassion. Therefore, AI cannot make another person feel understood and cared for. Even if AI improves in this area, it will be extremely difficult to get the technology to a place where humans feel comfortable interacting with robots in situations that call for care and empathy, or what we might call “human-touch services.”
3. **Dexterity.** AI and robotics cannot accomplish complex physical work that requires dexterity or precise hand-eye coordination. AI can’t deal with unknown and unstructured spaces, especially ones that it hasn’t observed.

This leaves two areas in the book publishing process.

The first is the **creative process**. It is clear that though AI will help with the craft, the process of creating and telling stories remains a human driven part of the writing process. 

The second is developing **communities**. In a world where all information will be available at all times knowing what you don't know and understanding the correct questions to asked becomes essential. This is where **opinionated and curated communities** come into play. These are selected groups of motivated people that are placed in a situation where they can:

- Develop deep human connections with link minded people. 
- Access curated information at the correct moments in their creative journey. 
- Operate in an environment where they have the freedom to ask the questions that need to maximize their creativity. 

This means that though the need for editorial services will reduce the writing community will flourish. I feel that BubbleCow needs to pivot away from editorial services and towards creating a **opinionated and curated community**. 

In the past, BubbleCow has worked on the idea that the [the only people getting rich in the Gold Rush were the merchants](https://history.howstuffworks.com/american-history/gold-rush.htm) Today, the landscape has changed but this still holds true. Though the editorial services will become less profitable, independent writers will continue to make money, perhaps more so as people thrust for creative projects. 

So... this is what BubbleCow will offer going forward:

- **Selling maps** - The only people getting rich in the Gold Rush were people selling shovels. We have been selling one type of shovel but technology have made this redundant, its time to switch and sell maps. Going forward, BubbleCow will show people how to be a successful writers.  
- **Lean into what AI can't do** - It seems that AI will replace a lot of traditional services and products. However, it will not be able to provide a **community** or **complicated and curated guidance**. It is these two things that we need to pivot to provide. 
## BubbleCow Strategy
The biggest problem we face going forward is uncertainty. Developing AI technology means that it is impossible to acutely predict more than a few month in advance. This means that BubbleCow must apply a strategy that mitigates risk as much as possible:

- **Experimentation by design** - The coming years will be complex and constantly changing. It is essential that any business has experimentation built into its design. Only be operating a policy of an experimentation first approach can we ensure that we will not be left behind in the changing landscape.
- **Customer led business** - Though it is essential we set out a clear direction, we must be led by customer requirements at all times. It is only by understanding how customers are using new technology and the requirement this creates that we can product suitable products and services. 
- **Stand out** - In a world were AI will commoditize processes and systems. It means that businesses will quickly become similar. It is therefore more important than ever to make sure that you stand out from the crowd. 
- **Opinionated and curated community** - It is essential to provide a community will a clear call to action, defined goals and obvious mindset. In a world of segmentation, only by standing out and having a clear message will you attract a group of passionate customers. 

This approach can be summed up the key key points from Seth Godon's book 'Purple Cow'. 

1. **Be Remarkable**: Godin argues that the only way to cut through the noise of the market is to be remarkable, like a purple cow in a field of brown cows. Being remarkable means offering something truly unique and valuable that stands out from the competition.
2. **Target Early Adopters**: Focus on the innovators and early adopters in your market, as they are more likely to try new things and spread the word to others. These individuals can provide valuable feedback and serve as evangelists for your product or service.
3. **Create Something Worth Talking About**: The product or service itself should inspire conversation. If people are excited to talk about what you offer, you'll benefit from word-of-mouth marketing, which is more effective and less expensive than traditional advertising.
4. **The Old Rules Don't Apply**: Godin emphasizes that the traditional marketing approach of creating average products for average people and spending heavily on advertising doesn't work in today's environment. Instead, companies should focus on creating unique products that appeal to specific niches.
5. **Be Daring and Innovative**: Companies need to take risks and be innovative to create a purple cow. This might involve rethinking product design, distribution, or how the service is provided to make it truly remarkable.
6. **The Product Is the Marketing**: In the era of the Purple Cow, the product or service itself becomes the main marketing tool. Its design, functionality, and user experience should be so outstanding that it naturally attracts attention and discussion.
7. **Focus on Design and Customer Experience**: Good design and an exceptional customer experience are critical in making a product or service remarkable. They can differentiate a company in a crowded marketplace and create loyal customers.
8. **Fail Fast and Learn**: Godin encourages businesses to try new ideas, even if they might fail. The key is to fail fast, learn from the experience, and iterate. This process of experimentation can lead to the discovery of a purple cow.
9. **Leverage Scarcity and Exclusivity**: Making a product scarce or exclusive can add to its appeal. People are drawn to what they can't have, and this desire can make a product more remarkable.
10. **Continuous Innovation**: Finally, Godin stresses the importance of continuous innovation. What's remarkable today may not be tomorrow, so businesses must keep evolving and pushing boundaries to stay relevant and remarkable.
