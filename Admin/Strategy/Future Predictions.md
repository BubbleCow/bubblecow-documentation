>  This section is the detailed outline for the re-imaging of BubbleCow and how I feel things will change in the future.

In the past, BubbleCow has been a single product service (developmental editing) relying on SEO to appear in the writers eye-line at point of service research. To date this has worked, but it is now under threat for several reasons, with the impact of AI being the most important.
## AI Improvements in Service
TLDR: **AI will reduce the number of people using developmental editors**. 

The use of AI generated reports will mean that editors will be able to produce feedback quickly and cheaply. The cost of these reports will be the price of the AI call plus, potentially, the some human input. This means reports can be generated for pennies. We may even see these services integrated at the point of writing (think Grammalry).

This will mean that editorial feedback will become a commodity. Though this feedback might not be as good (initially), it will still be good enough and cheap enough to outweigh this problem. We will see writers paying a relatively small amounts for feedback that will significantly improve their writing. This will not kill the editor generated reports completely, and we will still see a group of writers willing to pay Â£1500+ for a professional human edit. However, this number will drastically reduce. 

The result will be a further fragmentation of the market. I predict we will see Reedy go bust or pivot, at least one or two editorial suppliers disappear, and large number of freelancers drop from the marketplace.  
## AI Reduced Traffic
TLDR: **AI generated search results will reduce traffic**. 

Google are looking to use AI to answer certain types of questions at the point of search. This will result in them delivering answering via the Gemini LLM, with the added ability to 'chat' for a more detailed response. 

This logical and powerful approach will transform 'search'. Though there will be opportunists to benefit from this AI system, the immediate impact will be a significant, and unavoidable, drop in traffic to sites across the Internet. 

This will most remove 'casual' and non-intentioned traffic from sites. Though this will have a major impact on the traffic to a site, it could well be the case that though sites are getting less traffic, it is a of higher qaulity with better conversion. 

This means that SEO strategy, solid conversion practices and well designed websites become increasingly important. 
## Impact of Changes
I am, therefore, predicting several outcomes from AI driven changes to editorial services and website traffic.

- **Better books** - Low cost access to AI editorial tools will mean that the general quality of books will improve. Writers will be able to receive better and cheaper editorial support, plus help with the way in which they write. It will shift the focus away from craft and towards story telling.  This will, in turn, result in better reviews and more readers. This boost in sales will be matched with a reduction in pre-production costs making self-publishing an increasingly viable option for writers. 
- **Change in writing services** - Increase in the quality of AI editorial services, together with a reduction in traffic to the website, will mean a huge drop in business for developmental editing and copy editing. We are going to see these service become commodities, which, in turn, will decimate the current business landscape. However, the boost in the viability of successful independent writer means we see new and different services flourishing.
- **Changes to industry** - We will see a huge change in the landscape for editorial services. It is hard to see how Reedsy will survive. A reduction in the price you can charge for editing, together with a drop in number of writers seeking editing, will kill them. We will also see a reduction in editorial business that relay on editorial services. I also feel that freelancers will drop away since it will become unprofitable for them to edit at increasingly lower prices. It is difficult to predict but I think it will leave a small number of freelances and one or two big businesses. 

The results of these changes will be catastrophic for BubbleCow's current business model. A reduction in traffic, with a change in customer buying habits means that profit will tumble as writers become less and services become first cheaper, and the obsolete. 

However, BubbleCow has three important foundations that suggest that though it can't survive in its current form, it can pivot to plat a role in the next iteration of independent writers.

- **Knowledge and Expertise** - BubbleCow's deep understanding of writers, what they need to create great books and how to make these books a success means they have the insight needed to change with the changeing landscape. 
- **Reputation** - BubbleCow comes with fifteen plus years of solid reputation within the community. This will allow them to reposition and retain good will of writers. 
- **First Mover Advantage** - The fact BubbleCow see these problems so far in advance is a huge competitive advantage. There is currently no indication that any other competitor is making moves to survive. 
- **SEO** - Fifteen years of SEO means that BubbleCow have a robust marketing avenue that deispit changes will form the foundation for a new direction. 
## New Direction



This means that though the need for editorial services will reduce the writing community will flourish. I feel that BubbleCow needs to pivot away from editorial services and towards elements that AI can't provide. 


stand out - ai will commaditze
- **Selling maps** - The only people getting rich in the Gold Rush were people selling shovels. We have been selling one type of shovel but technology have made this redundant, its time to switch and sell maps. Going forward, BubbleCow will show people how to be a successful writers.  
- **Lean into what AI can't do** - It seems that AI will replace a lot of traditional services and products. However, it will not be able to provide a **community** or **complicated and curated guidence**. It is these two things that we need to pivot to provide.

## Vision and Message


Ideas (move)
- How can I use the waiting list idea for BubbleCow products (perhaps this is a course). I think it would would for en exclusive group, say ten people. They join the waiting list and then have to meet a criteria to join the group. Then, they are offered a limited time to sign up. 
- Consider a writing what's app group for free.
- Create a readiness assessment for if someone is ready for their book to be edited and what service works for them.
- Need to change the message for BubbleCow to be more about digital first. I need to give it a very clear identity, some thing I have failed to do. 
- Move myself to more of a figure head for the business?
