>  This section is the detailed outline for the re-imaging of BubbleCow and how I feel things will change in the future.

In the past, BubbleCow has been a single product service (developmental editing) relying on SEO to appear in the writers eye-line at point of service research. To date this has worked, but it is now under threat for several reasons, with the impact of AI being the most important.

## AI Improvements in Service
**AI will reduce the number of people using developmental editors**. The use of AI will mean that editors will be able to produce feedback quickly and cheaply. This will mean that though the feedback might not be a good, it will still be cheap enough to outweigh this problem. We will see writers paying a very small amount for feedback that will significantly improve their writing. It will not kill the traditional form of the service completely, and we will still see a group of writers willing to pay Â£1500+ for a professional human edit. However, this number will drastically reduce. The result will be a further fragmentation of the market. I predict we will see Reedy go bust or pivot, at least one or two editorial suppliers disappear a large number of freelancers drop from the marketplace.  
## AI Reduced Traffic
**AI generated search results will reduce traffic**. As Google move to AI solutions, where they seek to answer direct questions at the point of search, the number of visitors to sites will reduce. This will have a major impact on the traffic to a site and increase the importance of conversion. 

I am, therefore, predicting several outcomes.

- **Better books** - Low cost access to AI tools will mean that the general quality of books will improve. This will, in turn, result in better reviews and more readers. This boost in sales will be matched with a reduction in pre-production costs making self-publishing an increasingly viable option for writers. 
- **Less services** - Increase in the quality of AI editorial services, together with a reduction in traffic to the website, will mean a huge drop in business for developmental editing and copy editing. 
- **Significant changes to industry** - We will see a huge change in the landscape for editorial services. It is hard to see how Reedsy will survive; though their marketplace model remains valid a drop in writers will kill them. We will also see a reduction in editorial business that relay on editorial services. I also feel that freelancers will drop away. It is difficult to predict but I think it will leave a small number of freelances and one or two big businesses. 

This means that though the need for editorial services will reduce the writing community will flourish. I feel that BubbleCow needs to pivot away from editorial services and towards elements that AI can't provide. 

- **Selling maps** - The only people getting rich in the Gold Rush were people selling shovels. We have been selling one type of shovel but technology have made this redundant, its time to switch and sell maps. Going forward, BubbleCow will show people how to be a successful writers.  
- **Lean into what AI can't do** - It seems that AI will replace a lot of traditional services and products. However, it will not be able to provide a **community** or **complicated and curated guidence**. It is these two things that we need to pivot to provide.

## Vision and Message


Ideas (move)
- How can I use the waiting list idea for BubbleCow products (perhaps this is a course). I think it would would for en exclusive group, say ten people. They join the waiting list and then have to meet a criteria to join the group. Then, they are offered a limited time to sign up. 
- Consider a writing what's app group for free.
- Create a readiness assessment for if someone is ready for their book to be edited and what service works for them.
- Need to change the message for BubbleCow to be more about digital first. I need to give it a very clear identity, some thing I have failed to do. 
- Move myself to more of a figure head for the business?
