>  This is the detailed outline for the re-imaging of BubbleCow


## Predictions
In the past we have been a single product service (developmental editing) relying on great SEO to appear in the writers eye-line at point of service research. This will no longer be a viable option going forward for two key reasons:

1. **AI will reduce the number of people using developmental editors**. It will not kill the service completely and we will still see a group of writers willing to pay Â£1500+ for a professional human edit. However, in the coming years we are going to see AI solutions where a writer can get AI generated feedback for a fraction of the cost. This will not be as comprehensive and intuitive feedback but it will be good enough for a writer unwilling to pay for a full service. 
2. **AI generated search results will reduce traffic**. The site will lose a proportion of the traffic that is simply looking to answer a simple question. As it stands these will remain on the Google search page.

I am, therefore, predicting several outcomes.

- **Better books** - Low cost access to AI tools will mean that the general quality of books will improve. This will, in turn, result in better reviews and more readers. This boost in sales will be matched with a reduction in pre-production costs making self-publishing an increasingly viable option for writers. 
- **Less services** - Increase in the quality of AI editorial services, together with a reduction in traffic to the website, will mean a huge drop in business for developmental editing and copy editing. 
- **Significant changes to industry** - We will see a huge change in the landscape for editorial services. It is hard to see how Reedsy will survive; though their marketplace model remains valid a drop in writers will kill them. We will also see a reduction in editorial business that relay on editorial services. I also feel that freelancers will drop away. It is difficult to predict but I think it will leave a small number of freelances and one or two big businesses. 

This means that though the need for editorial services will reduce the writing community will flourish. I feel that BubbleCow needs to pivot away from editorial services and towards elements that AI can't provide. 

- **Selling maps** - The only people getting rich in the Gold Rush were people selling shovels. We have been selling one type of shovel but technology have made this redundant, its time to switch and sell maps. Going forward, BubbleCow will show people how to be a successful writers.  
- **Lean into what AI can't do** - It seems that AI will replace a lot of traditional services and products. However, it will not be able to provide a **community** or **complicated and curated guidence**. It is these two things that we need to pivot to provide.

## Vision and Message


Ideas (move)
- How can I use the waiting list idea for BubbleCow products (perhaps this is a course). I think it would would for en exclusive group, say ten people. They join the waiting list and then have to meet a criteria to join the group. Then, they are offered a limited time to sign up. 
- Consider a writing what's app group for free.
- Create a readiness assessment for if someone is ready for their book to be edited and what service works for them.
- Need to change the message for BubbleCow to be more about digital first. I need to give it a very clear identity, some thing I have failed to do. 
- Move myself to more of a figure head for the business?
