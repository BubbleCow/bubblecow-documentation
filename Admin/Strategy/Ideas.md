>  This is the detailed outline for the re-imaging of BubbleCow


## Ethos
In the past we have been a single product service (developmental editing) relying on great SEO to appear in the writers eye-line at point of service research. This will no longer be a viable option going forward for two key reasons:

1. **AI will reduce the number of people using developmental editors**. It will not kill the service completely and we will still see a group of writers willing to pay Â£1500+ for a professional human edit. However, in the coming years we are going to see AI solutions where a writer can get AI generated feedback for a fraction of the cost. This will not be as comprehensive and intuitive feedback but it will be good enough for a writer unwilling to pay for a full service. 
2. **AI generated search results will reduce traffic**. 


better books, more sales, more wroetres

## Vision and Message


Ideas (move)
- How can I use the waiting list idea for BubbleCow products (perhaps this is a course). I think it would would for en exclusive group, say ten people. They join the waiting list and then have to meet a criteria to join the group. Then, they are offered a limited time to sign up. 
- Consider a writing what's app group for free.
- Create a readiness assessment for if someone is ready for their book to be edited and what service works for them.
- Need to change the message for BubbleCow to be more about digital first. I need to give it a very clear identity, some thing I have failed to do. 
- Move myself to more of a figure head for the business?
