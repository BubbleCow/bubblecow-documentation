The **Pillar System Approach** looks to create content that is optimized for next generation search engines (including the potential impact of AI). It looks to create content that no only optimizes the user experience but also produces material that is evergreen and ranks well by design. This means that content is created from a 'search engine first' viewpoint. It is designed and presented in a way that is 'rewarded' by Google.

It is anticipated that changes to search technology through AI will reduce the overall traffic to any given site (since Google will be looking to keep traffic at the point of search with AI chat). However, Google have made it clear that SEO will remain important and its fundamental principles of providing the best user experience remain the unaltered.

Since the full impact of AI is likely to take many months, if not years (based on [Google's nervousness with hallucination](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-cautions-against-hallucinating-chatbots-report-2023-02-11/)) it is optimal is build a robust SEO strategy capable of being able to survive the transition. 

This approach will be focused on creating **SEO optimized, search specific content, grouped in a way that provides the optimal user experience**. 

The traditional way of thinking about SEO is to create single pages that rank well for the most popular key phrases. This is a hangover from Google early technology that was based on individual page experience for users, and Google's reliance on blunt metrics such as back links and bounce rate. This used to work but as Google has become more sophisticated it understands that a users journey is complex and branching, not linear. 

Google's focus has switched to 'promoting' **pages** that tick enough SEO boxes to **sites** that offer a more comprehensive user experience. Google is no longer looking for single pages SEO optimized pages, but a network of content that provides a better experience for the user.

This means that you have to shake the idea that you are creating content aimed at intercepting a user journey and 'converting' them on a single interaction. Instead, the mindset needs to switch to giving in-depth, topic relevant and broad content. This means that not only will Google expect a site to cover all key phrases, whether they individually rank or not, but also use focuses consent, resulting in situation where you might even talk about a competitor to offer the best user solution.

This requires a new way of thinking.

The approach has the added advantage that ranking for the number one, most competitive key phrases is no longer important and can, in fact, be ignored. 

Instead, effort is spent in creating content that though niche and specific is directly relevant to the user's needs. This not only helps users to have a better experience but also gives Google the type of user behavior it is seeking.  

What this looks like in practice is a web of related content cluster around a central pillar or hub.

These pillars or hubs are further connected to higher level pillar posts. 

This creates a pillar > sub-pillar > post set up. 

The approach is to create top level general pillar posts, this is followed by more specific sub-pillar and finally niche blog posts. 

Since this pillar system is giving Google what it needs, the need for back links to in posts can be ignored. It may be advantageous to have a small amount of paid search but this is simply to 'flag', the system to Google and should only be used once a network is set up. 

### Setting up the Network
The following steps can be used to set up a network.

1. Identify the mission critical keyword or phrase that matches the business. e.g. Book Editing or Content Marketing. 
2. Identify the key phrases that represent the important topics. 
3. Create a 16 piece pillar strategy

### 16 Piece Pillar Strategy

![[Pasted image 20231127104925.png]]

For each pillar you need the following:

- 1  x Pillar post with 3000+ words containing 20 keywords.
- 3 x Sub-pillar with 2000+ words containing 15 keywords.
- 3 x Blog with 1000+ words for each sub-pillar containing 8 keywords.

**It is important that the key phrase from the level above is mentioned in the content body.**

Blog post titles are created from the questions triggered by the sub-pillar post. When writing blog posts, this are based around the questions that people ask in relation to the titles. Theses should be h2.

So...

Title - What is the best way to write a blog post?

h2 - answer 1 to this question.
text - the answer to this question. 

h2 - answer 2 to this question.
text - the answer to this question. 

### Waves
The initial implementation is important. 

1. Publish the pillar post and tell Google and wait for it to be seen.
2. Publish all sub-pillars at once, tell Google and wait for them to be seen. 
3. 2. Publish all blogs at once, tell Google and wait for them to be seen. 

Content should always be added in waves.

Main advantages:

- More rapid results, often weeks not months. 

This is a cluster model with key pillars e.g. developmental editing with a cluster of posts. The pillars are interlinked.

Pillars should be things you can write multiple topics about, so not just 'developmental editing' but say 'self ediing'. If a subject has multiple possible topics it becomes a pillar.

Each post should start with a summary, which is in essence chasing a featured snippet, the a toc, also faq.

The snippet should be 45 words..
