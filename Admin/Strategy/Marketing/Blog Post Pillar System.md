The **Pillar System Approach** looks to create content that is optimized for next generation search engines (including the potential impact of AI). It looks to create content that no only optimizes the user experience but also produces material that is evergreen and ranks well by design. This means that content is created from a 'search engine first' viewpoint. It is designed and presented in a way that is 'rewarded' by Google.

It is anticipated that changes to search technology through AI will reduce the overall traffic to any given site (since Google will be looking to keep traffic at the point of search with AI chat). However, Google have made it clear that SEO will remain important and its fundamental principles of providing the best user experience remain the unaltered.

Since the full impact of AI is likely to take many months, if not years (based on [Google's nervousness with hallucination](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-cautions-against-hallucinating-chatbots-report-2023-02-11/)) it is optimal is build a robust SEO strategy capable of being able to survive the transition. 

This approach will be focused on creating **SEO optimized, search specific content, grouped in a way that provides the optimal user experience**. 

The traditional way of thinking about SEO is to create single pages that rank well for the most popular key phrases. This is a hangover from Google early technology that was based on individual page experience for users, and Google's reliance on blunt metrics such as back links and bounce rate. This used to work but as Google has become more sophisticated it understands that a users journey is complex and branching, not linear. 

Google has long emphasized the importance of user experience (UX) in its ranking algorithms, and this focus has become even more pronounced from 2020 onwards. 

1. **Introduction of Core Web Vitals**: In May 2020, Google introduced Core Web Vitals, a set of specific factors that Google considers important in a webpage's overall user experience. Core Web Vitals focus on three main aspects:
   - **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when a page first starts loading.
   - **First Input Delay (FID)**: Measures interactivity. Pages should have an FID of 100 milliseconds or less.
   - **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Measures visual stability. Pages should maintain a CLS of 0.1. or less.
2. **Page Experience Signal**: In 2021, Google started incorporating Core Web Vitals into its ranking criteria as part of the Page Experience Signal. This signal combines Core Web Vitals with other user experience factors such as mobile-friendliness, safe-browsing, HTTPS-security, and intrusive interstitial guidelines. Websites offering a better page experience are given preference in search results.
3. **Mobile-First Indexing**: Google has been prioritizing mobile-first indexing, meaning it predominantly uses the mobile version of the content for indexing and ranking. Since the majority of users now access the internet via mobile devices, this approach emphasizes the importance of mobile user experience in SEO strategies.
4. **Emphasis on Content Usability and Accessibility**: Google's algorithm updates have increasingly rewarded content that is not only high-quality and relevant but also accessible and usable across all devices and platforms. This includes readable font sizes, easy navigation, and compatibility with assistive technologies.
5. **User Engagement Metrics**: While Google does not explicitly confirm the use of specific user engagement metrics in ranking, it's widely understood that factors such as click-through rate (CTR), bounce rate, and dwell time can impact SEO. These metrics reflect user satisfaction with the search results and the quality of the user experience on a webpage.
6. **Updates to Combat Intrusive Interstitials**: Google has penalized websites that use intrusive interstitials—pop-ups that block the main content of a page—since these negatively impact the user experience, especially on mobile devices.
7. **Guidance and Resources for Webmasters and SEO Professionals**: Google provides extensive documentation, tools (like Google Search Console and PageSpeed Insights), and guidelines to help webmasters and SEO professionals improve their sites' user experience.

Google's focus has switched to 'promoting' **pages** that tick enough SEO boxes to **sites** that offer a more comprehensive user experience. This means that Google is no longer looking for single pages SEO optimized pages, but a network of content that provides a better experience for the user.

We must shake the idea that you are creating content aimed at hijacking a user journey and 'converting' them on a single interaction. Instead, the mindset needs to switch to giving in-depth, topic relevant and broad content. This means that not only will Google expect a site to cover all key phrases, whether they individually rank or not, but also use focuses content, resulting in situation where you might even talk about a competitor to offer the best user solution.

This requires a new way of thinking.

The approach has the added advantage that ranking for the number one, most competitive key phrases is no longer important and can, in fact, be ignored. 

Instead, effort is spent in creating content that though niche and specific is directly relevant to the user's needs. This not only helps users to have a better experience but also gives Google the type of user behavior it is seeking.  

What this looks like in practice is a web of related content cluster around a central pillar or hub. 

![[Pasted image 20231127104435.png]]

These pillars or hubs are further connected to higher level pillar posts. 

This creates a pillar > sub-pillar > post set up. 

The approach is to create top level general pillar posts, this is followed by more specific sub-pillar and finally niche blog posts. 

Since this pillar system is giving Google what it needs, the need for back links to in posts can be ignored. It may be advantageous to have a small amount of paid search but this is simply to 'flag', the system to Google and should only be used once a network is set up. 
## Setting up the Network
The approach to creating a network consists of three key steps:

1. Identify the mission critical keywords or phrases that matches the business. e.g. Book Editing or Content Marketing. These are **pillars**.
2. Identify a range of key phrases within the pillars, these are **sub-pillars**.
3. Create **blog** content for key phrases with the sub-pillars.
### The 16 Piece Pillar Strategy

![[Pasted image 20231127104925.png]]

This is the strategy developed by [DemandJump](https://www.demandjump.com/) and represents what they feel is an optimal set up. 

For each pillar you need the following:

- 1 x Pillar post with 3000+ words containing 20 keywords.
- 3 x Sub-pillar with 2000+ words containing 15 keywords.
- 3 x Blog with 1000+ words for each sub-pillar containing 8 keywords.

The pillar and sub-pillars topics are created from careful research and industry knowledge. 

Blog post titles are created from the questions triggered by the sub-pillar post when added to Google. When writing blog posts, this are based around the questions that people ask in relation to the titles. Theses should be h2.

So...

Title - What is the best way to write a blog post?

h2 - answer 1 to this question.
text - the answer to this question. 

h2 - answer 2 to this question.
text - the answer to this question. 

The initial implementation is important. 

1. Publish the pillar post and tell Google and wait for it to be seen.
2. Publish all sub-pillars at once, tell Google and wait for them to be seen. 
3. 2. Publish all blogs at once, tell Google and wait for them to be seen. 

Content should always be added in waves.

> [!warning]
> There is no question that this system works, but we have experimented and have developed a number of improvements and objections:
> - The blog post should focus on **one exact match phrase**. This will mean you are producing more that sixteen pieces of content. 
> - The wave approach to publishing is less critical than DemandJump suggest. Our experience that the order of publication is not having enough impact on ranking speed to be a significant factor. 

### The Exact Match Pillar Strategy
We have developed a more sophisticated approach to the pillar system using our own research and experimentation. 

The fundamentals of the approach remain the same:

1. Identify the mission critical keywords or phrases that matches the business. e.g. Book Editing or Content Marketing. These are **pillars**.
2. Identify a range of key phrases within the pillars, these are **sub-pillars**.
3. Create **blog** content for key phrases with the sub-pillars.

However, the execution at each level differs. It is important to pay close attention to each type of content and the elements that are required.
#### Overall Blog Structure
One of the fundamental elements of this system working is the application of **update date SEO strategy**. The blog and content must, at all times, meet Google expectations of high ranking content. The best place to start is with Google's [Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Starter Guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide). 

However, assuming these guidelines are being followed the following factors are essentail:

> [!info]
> - Ensure that the blog has a **clear, two level hierarchical category system**, which matches the pillar and sub-pillar system. e.g. Book Editing > Developmental Editing. 
> - Ensure that blog and all posts have a clear breadcrumb system with the correct [Structured data for breadcrumbs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/breadcrumb)
> - Clear URL structure is essential, if possible enhancing the category and breadcrumb. e.g. site.com/blog/category/post 

#### Pillars
It is important to understand that the number and content of the pillars is not set in stone. It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you need the exact number of pillars with the correct phrase. That is not the case. You will find that you have more flexibility than you realize. 
##### Deciding on Pillar Phrase
When picking pillars here are some rules:
- Google assigns a category to your website, this might be broad, such as educational or travel, but might also me more specific such as gardening. The pillars you pick should make sense in relation to your site's identity. There will be some tangential pillars but these need to be used carefully. The goal is always to provide content your users will need. 
- It is essential that you have pillars for all key aspects of a site's identity. So with BubbleCow, it makes sense to have a pillar for each of our services - developmental editing, copy editing and manuscript assessment. 
- Your pillars should make logical sense and be a broad as possible. 
- Your pillars are not set in stone, they will change as the market alters over time. 
##### Pillar Format
The pillar article should be presented as the 'essential' or 'ultimate' guide to the topic chosen. For example, 'the essential guide to book editing'.

The best way think about the pillar article is as a hub for all other sub-pillar articles within that pillar. So, for example, the pillar article for 'book editing' would cover topics such as 'developmental editing', 'copy editing' and 'manuscript assessment'.

You **must not** fall into the trap of thinking that this article is being created for SEO purposes. IT IS NOT. This article is simply a hub that connects your ranking content and its purpose is to signal to Google that the content is linked. 

Here are some metadata considerations:
- **Title**: This should be simple and contain the pillar phrase. The best practice would be 'ultimate guide to...'
- **Category**: The pillar phrase should have it's own, parent level, category. For example 'book editing'
- **URL**: This should be simple and match the pillar phrase. For example site.com/book-editing/ultimate-guide-book-editing 
- **Key Image**: This will set the tone for other images in the category. The Alt text should contain the pillar phrase. 

This is the best format for the post:
1. **Image** - this should be related to the topic and, ideally, used as an inspiration for the images for sub-pillar posts. 
2. **Introduction** - this should be an introduction to the topic and, ideally, contain one link to an high ranking external source (for example Wikipedia).
3. **Sub-pillar post section** -  This contains the following:
	- Image from the pillar article with the correct structured data for the image. The alt text is descriptive but also contains the sub-pillar phrase.
	- Unique text that is related to the sub-pillar phrase. This is 300 to 500 words in length. It is not SEO optimized. 
	- A call out with a link to the sub-pillar article. This ahref text for this post will include the sub-pillar phrase. 
#### Sub-pillars
Like pillars, sub-pillar articles are not SEO driven. You are not trying to drive traffic to the pillars. Instead, you are creating hubs that Google will use to bind your content together. That said, sub-pillar articles will be written in a way that makes it possible to rank for non-google snippets.
##### Deciding on Sub-pillar Article Phrase
Having determined the pillars, the sub-pillar articles can then determined. There is no set way to decide on sub-pillars and they may not be immediately obvious. Experience suggests that this is a fluid and on-going process. 

Often, the best place to start is by looking for the types of search terms that are being found under the sub-pillar. These will ultimately be posts, but they are often a good indicator of a potential sub-pillars. 

For example, if you search on 'book editing', a pillar term, you get the following:

- What is the average cost to edit a book?
- How to do book editing?
- What do you need to become a book editor?
- What is the meaning of book editing?

It is likely that each of these will be post, but they do suggests that 'cost of developmental editing' might be a good sub-pillar. 

As a general rule we would want a minimum of at least three posts under each sub-pillar. So if you feel there is at least this many exact phrases you might have a sub-pillar. 

It is worth remembering that your initial set up of sub-pillars might alter as you find new ones or decide that a single sub-pillar is worthy of the multiple sub-pillars. 
##### Sub-pillar Format
The sub-pillar article should be presented as the 'guide' to the topic chosen. For example 'the guide to developmental editing'. You should avoid using phrases such as 'ultimate', since this is related to the pillar articles.

The sub-pillar is a hub for all the posts and directly linked to the pillar article. This sub-pillar's role is to provide structure for Google and to show how the posts of linked and related. 

You **must not** fall into the trap of thinking that this sub-pillar article is being created for SEO purposes. IT IS NOT. However, one key role of this post is to try to capture [SEO snippets](https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/featured-snippets). 

Here are some metadata considerations:
- **Title**: This should be simple and contain the sub-pillar phrase. The best practice would be 'guide to...'
- **Category**: The sub-pillar phrase should have it's own, child level, category. For example 'book editing > **developmental editing**'
- **URL**: This should be simple and match the pillar phrase. For example site.com/book-editing/developmental-editing/ 
- **Key Image**: The tone of the image should match that of the parent pillar. The Alt text should contain the sub-pillar phrase. 

This is the best format for the post:
1. **Image** - this should be related to the topic and, ideally, use the pillar post image as an inspiration. 
2. **Introduction** - this should be an introduction to the topic and, ideally, contain one link to an high ranking external source (for example Wikipedia).
3. Table of Contents - this is a active table of contents using structured data. 
4. **Post section** -  This contains the following:
	- Image from the post with the correct structured data for the image. The alt text is descriptive but also contains the post phrase.
	- Unique text that is related to the post exact phrase. This is 40 to 50 words in length. It is not SEO optimized but IT IS designed to try and grab the SEO snippet. The post is focused on AI carousel, this is non-AI SEO snippet. 
	- A link to the sub-pillar post. This ahref text for this post will include the post exact phrase. all out with 

The end of the post needs a **Bootstrap call out** with a link to the pillar article. This is another indicator to Google about the structure of the pillar system.

Not that a 'further reading' section is automatically created on the BubbleCow blog that links to all other posts in the category. 

#### Posts
Unlike pillar and sub-pillar articles, the post's main purpose is SEO. It the posts that are going to rank most frequently and drive the most traffic to the site. 

This means that these posts most follow sound SEO guidelines as default. However, in addition they will follow two important principles:
- Exact match.
- AI optimization.
##### Exact Match Principles
The foundation of the ranking for posts is that they are build around 


Each post should start with a summary, which is in essence chasing a featured snippet, the a toc, also faq.

https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/featured-snippets

The snippet should be 45 words..
