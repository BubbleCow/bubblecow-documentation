## Demoncratsation of Pulbishing
. Bubblecow belives in the democrtasation of publishing. It believes that every book has an audience and every writer shoudl have the chance to share thier work. They don't believe that this work should be gatekeeping by a publisher. BubbleCow bleibe that it shoudl eb readers that choice what they want to reader. We believ that writers have a duty to create the best books possible but beyond that it shoudl eb the reader, not the publisher that decide success. It shoudl eb the best stoires that are read, not the best marketed. Publishers are killing writers not lifting them up

 The biggets problem BubbleCow have faced is convincing writers that publishers don't have a writer's best interst at heart. It is showing writers that publishers are lying to them and the chances of them being a success are tiny. Spreadin gthe message that there is a different way to do thing has been hard since publishers doini't want writers to knwo this. 
## Future

 Out goal for the future is to help a new generateion of writers to become a succes. we want to see a world when all writers are created equal and each book is taken on its merits. We want to see a world where writers can devleop a readership that wuiull allow them to create a long term sustainable writing career. 
 
## Best-seller Model
**Traditional publishing follows the bestseller model, which BubbleCow believes fundamentally damages a writers change of being a success.** 

The main problem a publisher faces is that it is impossible to predict which book they publish will be a success. The only thing they know is that only 20% of the books published will be sell enough copies to cover production costs and only 20% of these books will create so many sales that they so widely profitable that they will cover the cost of all other books published AND still make a profit. 

These highly profitable books are considered bestseller. The most successful bestsellers will break out of their genre and appeal across the board to readers of many, often unrelated genres. 

The problem is that though it is possible to recognize the elements of a bestseller, the exact recipe remains a mystery. This means that the job of a publisher is to take takes to reject all books that are clear never going to be a bestseller and accept only books that have the elements of a bestseller. 

The publishing process then becomes a system of publishing potential bestseller and paying close attention to early sales. Books that show the initial sales profile of a bestseller are then seized upon, whilst the rest are dropped and rejected. A publisher will then spend the majority of its energy creating as many sales as possible from these bestsellers. 

Whilst it is in the publishers best interest to find as many new and exciting titles, this is not in the best interest of the writer. Only a fraction of books will be a success and if a writers is not part of this story, their book will be quickly rejected and left to rot. 

Over the years, publishers have perpetrated the myth of the bestselling author despite the fact that very few writers make enough money from traditional book sales to make writing a full time career.  
## Reverse Publishing
One way to think about the traditional publishing model is that they publish books and then seek out readers. This is a wasteful approach to publishing. It means that publishers require a large number of books that will, ultimately, be unsuccessful.

There is another model. 

This is the reverse process where a writer finds the readers first and then creates the books they want to read. This process requires writers to be fully connected with their readership, possessing an intimate understanding of what these readers want and enjoy. The writer will then create books for this readership. If done correctly, the readers will be waiting for the book, almost guaranteeing success. 

It is important to note that writers are not writing what they are told, they are, instead, writing the books that readers are keen to read.

## AI will Bring Better Books
Low cost access to AI editorial tools will mean that the general quality of books will improve. Writers will be able to receive better and cheaper editorial support, plus help with the way in which they write. It will shift the focus away from craft and towards story telling.  This will, in turn, result in better reviews and more readers. This boost in sales will be matched with a reduction in pre-production costs making self-publishing an increasingly viable option for writers. to AI editorial tools will mean that the general quality of books will improve.

## Better as a community 
We are better as a group of likeminded people. Only by taking on and defining solid indepenbdant publishging proicates can we fight about a publishing system that it designed to see us fail. We must define and play by new rules. We can never win playing the publishing rules. 

## Branding Style
To create a cohesive visual identity for a rebel archetype company serving writers, using the modified Harley-Davidson palette, here are the colors with their corresponding HEX codes, explanations of their usage, and indications of their relative importance:

1. **Charcoal Gray (#333940)**
    - **Usage**: This should be used as a primary background color or for text to provide depth and sophistication. It's a neutral color that conveys strength and authority without the starkness of pure black.
    - **Intention**: To evoke a sense of reliability and seriousness, grounding the brand's more vibrant colors and ensuring readability.
    - **Importance**: High. As a foundational color, it anchors the palette and provides versatility across various applications.
2. **Burnt Orange (#CC5500)**
    - **Usage**: Ideal for calls to action, highlights, or key graphics to draw attention and stimulate emotions.
    - **Intention**: To inject energy and creativity into the design, encouraging action and conveying a spirit of adventure and innovation.
    - **Importance**: High. It's the primary accent color that adds personality and distinguishes the brand's identity.
3. **Cream White (#FFFDD0)**
    - **Usage**: Use for background areas to soften the overall look, for text on dark backgrounds, or as a contrasting element.
    - **Intention**: To offer a comforting and welcoming feel, making the content more approachable and easier on the eyes.
    - **Importance**: Medium. It enhances the palette's warmth and accessibility, important for user engagement and content readability.
4. **Slate Blue (#708090)**
    - **Usage**: Suitable for secondary accents, such as icons, borders, or to add a subtle contrast without overwhelming the design.
    - **Intention**: To convey trust, stability, and a calm authority, balancing the palette's warmth with a serene touch.
    - **Importance**: Medium. It provides a complementary color that supports the primary and secondary colors, contributing to the brand's narrative of innovation and thoughtfulness.

The colors listed are designed to work in harmony, each serving a specific purpose within the brand's visual identity. **Charcoal Gray and Burnt Orange** are the more important colors as they establish the brand's core identityâ€”reliability and creativity, respectively. **Cream White** and **Slate Blue** play supportive roles, enhancing the palette's diversity and emotional range. The strategic use of these colors will help communicate the company's rebellious, innovative spirit and its commitment to supporting writers in a distinctive, memorable way.
