1. BubbleCow sets itself aside from the mainstream by suggesting that wriers shoudl rejected the bestseller model of traditional publisghers, where 80% of writers are dsigarded, in favour of creating books for readers. We feel writers shoudl define thier own success and ignore what they are told by society. Ona day-to-day basis we provide writers with the tools, serverices, products and education that they need to make thier books a success without the help of publishers. 
   2. The target market is split into people thinking about writing a book, though that are writing and need help, those preapre thier books fro publication for the first time and those that have establised a writing carerr but are looking for more. 
   3. We provide a complete solution, we are a community and way ot thinking more than a service. We focus on mindset and approach, as well as proviidng the tools and education needed fro success.

   5. Bubblecow belives in the democrtasation of publishing. It believes that every book has an audience and every writer shoudl have the chance to share thier work. They don't believe that this work should be gatekeeping by a publisher. BubbleCow bleibe that it shoudl eb readers that choice what they want to reader. We believ that writers have a duty to create the best books possible but beyond that it shoudl eb the reader, not the publisher that decide success. It shoudl eb the best stoires that are read, not the best marketed. 
   6. Out goal for the future is to help a new generateion of writers to become a succes. we want to see a world when all writers are created equal and each book is taken on its merits. We want to see a world where writers can devleop a readership that wuiull allow them to create a long term sustainable writing career. 
   7. The biggets problem BubbleCow have faced is convincing writers that publishers don't have a writer's best interst at heart. It is showing writers that publishers are lying to them and the chances of them being a success are tiny. Spreadin gthe message that there is a different way to do thing has been hard since publishers doini't want writers to knwo this. 
   8. BubbleCow aims to build comminties of likeminded writers. We beliebe in openess, transparaty and coolbaration. Only being group totgwtaher cna we learn how to gorw and being better wrieres and an every changing pulbishign landscape.
