Ideas (move)
- How can I use the waiting list idea for BubbleCow products (perhaps this is a course). I think it would would for en exclusive group, say ten people. They join the waiting list and then have to meet a criteria to join the group. Then, they are offered a limited time to sign up. 
- Consider a writing what's app group for free.
- Create a readiness assessment for if someone is ready for their book to be edited and what service works for them.
- Need to change the message for BubbleCow to be more about digital first. I need to give it a very clear identity, some thing I have failed to do. 
- Move myself to more of a figure head for the business?
