## Understanding Your Feedback
Thank you for trusting in my feedback. I have provided professional feedback since 2007, and this report is a short reflection of what you can expect from a full edit. 

This feedback **is not a full edit** but is a fair representation of the type of editorial support you will receive in the final edit. Since this is a short extract of your book, I have yet to assess the overall narrative structure, which would be considered in the full edit. The focus is on sentence structure and apparent developmental issues. However, I have still approached the revision intending to provide a frank and honest assessment. 

In addition to this editor’s report, you will also find the edited manuscript containing two types of feedback: **comments** and **tracked changes**. 
### Comments 
The comments will appear on the right-hand side of the manuscript. You will be able to remove this comment if required; you are also able to add your thoughts to the comments. Many authors find this is an excellent way to fine-tune the rewriting process as they allow you to reflect on the editorial assessment within your manuscript. 

While the comments in your sample manuscript are often extensive, the comments will be more developed in the full edit and add greater depth to the overall feedback.

Comments support the thoughts and themes developed in the editor’s report. They allow the editor to highlight localized examples and provide ‘in situ’ feedback. In addition, comments can indicate wider structural issues.

You will often find that problems highlighted in the editor’s report will be further developed with real-life examples in the manuscript. 
### Tracked Changes
Tracked changes are like magic. Once they are turned on, they record everything that happens to your manuscript. You then can go in and ‘accept’ or ‘reject’ the changes as you see fit. 

The way the tracked changes appear on your machine will vary depending on your machine and software setup. Typically, they will show the original text removed in red and the new text replacing it in black. However, depending on your settings, this will sometimes be the case. For example, in manuscripts requiring a large number of alterations, it is common for an editor to ‘turn off’ the original text and only show the changes. 

If you are having problems seeing the tracked changes, the first place to look is your settings; the two important elements are: ‘simple markup’ and ‘all markup’. If using Word, I suggest you look in the ‘review’ section of the ribbon at the top of your manuscript and ensure that you have set the markup to ‘all markup’. This way, you can see all the possible changes.

## Editorial Feedback
I liked your edit, and I found the story engaging. 

### Sentence-Level Issues
There were a few sentence-level issues, but nothing I would not have expected to see in a manuscript at this stage in the publishing process. I have corrected these and will do so in the full edit.
#### Paragraph Indentation
I noticed that the first paragraph of each chapter is indented, while the rest are flush with the left margin. In contrast to standard formatting guidelines, you have opted to indent the first paragraph. However, it is a common practice in publishing to have the first paragraph of each chapter flush left and the rest indented. This style choice maintains consistency and makes the manuscript more visually appealing to readers.

To implement this change, simply remove the indentation from the first paragraph of each chapter and ensure that all subsequent paragraphs have a consistent indentation. This will create a more polished look for your manuscript and align it with established formatting standards.

#### Use of Exclamation Marks
Throughout the manuscript, I noticed the frequent use of exclamation marks. While exclamation marks can effectively convey strong emotions or emphasis, overusing them can weaken their impact and may be unprofessional or overly dramatic. In addition, excessive use of exclamation marks can disrupt the flow of the narrative and be distracting to the reader.

To improve your manuscript's overall tone and readability, I recommend limiting the use of exclamation marks. Reserve them for moments of high emotional intensity or when it is crucial to emphasize a particular point. By being more selective with your use of exclamation marks, you can strengthen your narrative and create a more balanced and engaging reading experience.

To address this issue, review your manuscript and identify instances where exclamation marks can be replaced with periods or other punctuation marks. Rephrasing sentences to convey the intended emotion or emphasis through the choice of words and sentence structure rather than relying on exclamation marks. This will result in a more polished and professional manuscript.
