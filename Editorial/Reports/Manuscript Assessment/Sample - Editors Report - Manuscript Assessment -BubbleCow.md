## Understanding Your Feedback
Before I launch into more detailed feedback, I thought I’d review how the assessment has been structured.

You will have two files:

1.    The manuscript.
2.    The editor’s report.

The first is your original manuscript but now contains detailed editorial notes. This is a Word document and includes comments. If you don’t use Word, don’t worry; most modern word processing packages can ‘read’ Word manuscripts. Alternatively, you can download this excellent word processing software for free - [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/). If you are having problems seeing your feedback, just let us know.

Before you dive in, I think it will help if you understand the ethos behind BubbleCow’s approach to providing feedback.

The approach is to provide clear and truthful feedback. If we see a problem, this will not only be highlighted. But at least one potential solution is provided. There are two types of feedback, those based on clear editorial best practices (e.g., showing, not telling) and those based on the editor's opinion. When a suggestion is based on opinion, it will be indicated. 

The role of the editor’s report is to provide a wider overview of the editing process. This means that if we have made suggestions to the manuscript that require a deeper rationale, these have been outlined and explained in the report. 
### Editor’s Report
The editor’s report should be read first and is designed to ease you into the editing process by providing an overview and explanation. The aim is for you to use the feedback in both the manuscript and this report as a means of formulating a plan to elevate your manuscript to the next level. 

I’ve split the report into several sections…
#### General Issues
In this section, we offer a comprehensive assessment of the novel, pinpointing issues and suggesting solutions to improve its overall quality. By utilizing both chapter-specific feedback and broader evaluations, the author gains actionable insights into the manuscript's strengths and weaknesses, addressing micro and macro elements. This holistic approach ensures a well-rounded examination, resulting in a polished and engaging novel for readers to enjoy.
#### Chapter Feedback
In this section, we provide an in-depth, chapter-by-chapter assessment of the novel, focusing on both strengths and areas for improvement. This granular approach offers insights into plot development, character progression, pacing, and style. It's essential to use this analysis in conjunction with the general issues discussed elsewhere in the report, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the novel's structure and narrative arc. This meticulous evaluation equips the author with the knowledge to refine and elevate their manuscript to its highest potential.

Once you delve into the feedback, I’d suggest you read the notes and then take a day or two to absorb what I’ve suggested. If you disagree with any changes, that’s fine, but please do take a little time to think them over before getting back to me. If, after this ‘cooling-off period’ you have any questions or comments, please don’t hesitate to email me at gary@bubblecow.com.
## General Issues
In this section of the report, we delve into a thorough assessment of the novel, focusing specifically on identifying problems, offering examples for clarity, and suggesting potential solutions to enhance the overall quality of the manuscript. We aim to provide the author with actionable insights that can be applied to strengthen the novel's plot, characters, pacing, and other essential elements.

This in-depth analysis should be used with the detailed feedback provided for each chapter, as the two sections complement each other to create a comprehensive understanding of the novel's strengths and weaknesses.

Combining the chapter-specific feedback with this broader evaluation, you will be well-equipped to address your manuscript's micro and macro aspects. This holistic approach ensures that every facet of the novel is considered, leading to a more polished and engaging final product for readers to enjoy.

### Line Edit

Please note that I have carried out a line edit on the prologue. This is to give you an indication of the errors you are making and provide a ‘blueprint’ for the types of things you should be looking to correct. 

### Overview
I enjoyed your book. I think its biggest asset is how well it fits your genre and your reader’s expectations. You perfectly use the genre’s tropes, making your book accessible but fresh. 

One thing that struck me was that your book fits firmly into the military science fiction subgenre. You must ensure that it is marketed as this and that you pick a suitable cover. As I read, I was reminded of several other books, but Starship Troopers and Ender’s Game were prominent. 

I also liked your characters and the world you were building. They felt fully formed, and the world was developed in a way that would support multiple stories. 

Please note that I have approached this novel to try to remove sections that I felt were unnecessary and reduce the overall word count. 

This all said several issues need to be addressed. I have detailed these below but thought I would outline the most important ones. The biggest problem, by far, is the lack of narrative tension and conflict. Almost half of this book is ‘training’, and though this is interesting, it results in a weaker plot and less overall movement. In fact, in some ways, it is only the last fifty pages where the plot accelerates and the story unfolds. I  also felt that you were often telling, when you should be showing, and you need to ensure that you add sufficient description each time a character or location is introduced. 

### Narrative Tension
Narrative tension is a critical element in storytelling, as it engages readers and keeps them turning the pages of a novel. The driving force propels the story forward, creating anticipation and uncertainty about the outcome of events. Conflict, in its various forms, is essential in generating narrative tension, as it introduces obstacles, challenges, and dilemmas that the characters must overcome or navigate throughout the story.

Conflict can manifest in numerous ways, such as internal struggles within a character, clashes between characters, or external forces that hinder a character's goals or desires. These conflicts serve to create tension by raising the stakes, forcing characters to make difficult decisions, and revealing their true natures under pressure. When skillfully woven into the fabric of a story, conflict can shape character development, dictate the pace, and influence the overall narrative arc.

The presence of conflict is crucial because it prevents the story from becoming stagnant or predictable. Readers are more likely to lose interest in a tale that lacks tension or obstacles, as it may feel flat and uneventful. Furthermore, conflict provides opportunities for characters to grow, change, and evolve, making them more relatable and dynamic.

A well-crafted narrative will balance tension and conflict with moments of resolution, allowing readers to experience a range of emotions as they become invested in the story's outcome. By carefully introducing and resolving conflicts, an author can create a satisfying narrative that maintains a sense of momentum while also allowing the reader to catch their breath and process the story's events.

The issue you face is that for most of your novel, there is little or no narrative tension. 

At the beginning of the novel, the main character is propelled on a journey as he discovers his skills and the prophecy, and this works well. However, issues arise in the training section. I would say that at least half of your book is training. I have no a problem with this other than there is no conflict during this period. The training is unfolding by the main characters are under no pressure. You mention the war and other threats, but these are distant and unrelated to the main character. In this training section, the main character's actions have no impact on the plot. 

Here are some possible ways to introduce tension and conflict:

- Bring forward the timetable of war. Make it so that war breaks out almost immediately, and the pressure is on to get the earthlings ready for war. There needs to be this constant pressure on them into battle. There needs to a pressure for them to succeed. 
    
- Drill down on the importance of the main character in winning the war. There must be a constant dialogue about the fact that without the prophet, they will lose. It must feel that a rearguard action is being fought while they race to train the prophet. 
    
- There should be a final pass/fail simulation. This should be a final exam that all earthlings MUST pass. If they fail, they are sent home. This creates a narrative arc, which, when combined with more pressure from the war, will drive the reader forward. 

### This Therefore This
The "This Therefore This" technique is a valuable method for establishing and maintaining narrative flow in a story, ensuring that each scene is dependent on the actions of the previous one. This dependency creates a natural sense of progression, making it easier for readers to follow the plot and stay engaged.

This system was popularized by Matt Stone & Trey Parker, the creators of the popular TV show "South Park." They use this technique to ensure that the stories they tell in each episode of their show have a well-defined narrative arc. Many writers have adopted a similar process in their work, finding it useful for creating cohesive and engaging narratives.

In contrast, "This Then This" represents a narrative structure where scenes are not interconnected, often leading to a disjointed and less compelling story. By focusing on the "This Therefore This" approach, writers can create a more cohesive and engaging narrative, allowing the main character to be the driving force in the novel.

To implement the "This Therefore This" technique, start by examining each scene in your story and identify how it is linked to the previous one. If a scene is isolated and could occur independently without impacting the overall narrative, consider revising it to establish a stronger connection to the prior scene. This will help ensure that your main character's actions and decisions directly influence the story's progression.

In addition to enhancing narrative flow, the "This Therefore This" technique can also help to maintain a consistent pace and rhythm throughout the story. When each scene depends on the previous one, readers are more likely to be drawn into the story, experiencing a greater sense of momentum and emotional investment.

Utilizing the "This Therefore This" technique, as popularized by the creators of "South Park," can greatly improve the narrative structure of a novel by ensuring that each scene is interconnected and dependent on the actions of the main character. This approach strengthens the overall plot and keeps readers engaged and invested in the story.

### Switching Viewpoints
When writing a novel, particularly in the first-person perspective, it's essential to maintain a consistent focus on the main character. This ensures that readers can easily follow the story and remain engaged with the protagonist's journey. However, some writers may be tempted to include chapters from different characters' viewpoints, leading to confusion and disrupting the narrative flow. This is something you occasionally do.

To maintain clarity and avoid reader confusion, minimizing switching viewpoints in a first-person narrative is generally advised. If it's necessary to convey information from other characters' perspectives, consider alternative methods to achieve this without disrupting the focus on the main character.

One effective approach is to incorporate the information from other characters into scenes where the main character is present. By doing so, the protagonist can learn about these events or insights directly, allowing the story to remain centered on their perspective. This can be achieved through actions, observations, or interactions with other characters in the scene.

Another option is to convey the information through dialogue with the main character. This can be particularly useful when it's crucial for the protagonist to learn about an event or gain insight into another character's thoughts or feelings. By incorporating this information into conversations, the writer can maintain the first-person perspective while still providing readers with a broader understanding of the story's events and characters.

### Description
Your work would benefit from the use of additional location and character descriptions. 

The lack of description is a common problem for many authors. I am not suggesting that you have pages of flowery prose, but you do need to add enough description to allow the reader to ‘paint’ a picture of the characters and locations in their mind’s eye. On occasion, you tend to tell rather than show, and the use of additional description will go some way to solving this problem. 

Stephen King said writing is an act of telepathy. He said a writer's job was to pass a picture of a scene from their brain into the reader's brain. You must get images from your mind into the reader’s mind. The way to do this is via character and location description. 

You must know that any words a writer uses will never be as powerful as the reader’s imagination. For example, if you say ‘door,’ it will conjure an image in the reader’s mind. ‘Green door’ will invoke a different image, ‘green door with flaking paint and brass door handle,’ yet another.

The reader is constantly painting a picture of the book’s current scene in their mind’s eye. You must continuously update this picture, giving the reader enough information to ‘see’ the picture as you wish. 

This sounds a little complex, but the technique is simple. 

Here are a few rules:

1. If a location changes, then add a new description of the location. This means that you need a new description if a character walks from one place to another.
2. If a new character enters a scene, add a description of that character. 
    
This raises the question of how much description is enough; again, there are a few simple rules.

If the character/location is minor, then add a small amount of description. For example, the waiter who makes a fleeting appearance delivering a meal might simply be ‘the waiter.’ However, if the character is going to linger in a scene, but only one scene, then you will need a couple of lines. In this case, the waiter might become ‘the waiter was tall, perhaps six foot with neatly cut black hair, but with bushy eyebrows.’

However, if the character/location is significant, you need a large amount of description. As a general rule of thumb, a character in more than one scene needs to be treated in this fashion. The best way to approach this type of character/location is to initially provide a couple of lines of description, then, as appropriate, continue to layer in an occasional line of description. This way, the reader can build an increasingly complex picture in their mind’s eye. 

One additional tip is to use the scene as a backdrop for providing a description. So, for example, if a character walks into a room, you can say something like, ‘they looked around the room.’ This then gives you a trigger to describe the room in a way that fits the narrative. You can extend this to a character. If, for example, you wanted to describe a new character that has entered a room. You could just describe the character, and this would work. However, if you can link this to the location, it is more natural. For example, say the character enters a brightly lit room; you can then write something like… ‘He lifted this large hand to cover his eyes, his scruffy beard poking from behind his fingers.’ Not the best sentence, but you get the picture. 

Remember, the reader constantly paints a picture in their mind’s eye. They will do this whether you provide a sufficient description or not. If the picture in the reader’s mind and the one in your mind become too separated, the reader will become confused. 

### Show, Don’t Tell
One of the most common reasons a reader stops reading a book is that they become bored. Therefore, your role as a writer is to keep the reader engaged. Fortunately, this process is not too difficult.

When reading a book, the reader must feel part of the story. They must feel as if they our ‘in’ the story, experiencing what is happening. The best way for this to happen is for you to treat the reader as an observer to a scene. This means that you SHOW the reader all that is happening, not TELL them.

For example, if you were to write:

‘The woman was happy.’

This would be TELL. You are TELLING the reader the woman’s emotion. However, if you wrote:

‘The woman smiled at first, and then jumped in the air, clapping her hands.’ 

 This would be SHOW. You are describing the woman’s actions. The reader remains part of the scene and, hopefully, the character’s actions trigger an emotion in the reader. 

By SHOWING, not TELLING, emotions, plot and back-story you are forcing the reader to ‘lean into’ the book. This keeps them engaged and part of the process. Each time you TELL the reader something about the story, the reader is pushed onto the back foot and disengages, too much TELL and they stop reading. 

The aim is to create a narrative space between the character and the reader. 

By showing the reader what is happening, but not telling them, you force the reader to work out the reasons for themselves. This way they build their own picture of your characters.

One issue this immediately raises is that of passing back-story for a character and key plot information. 

How can this be done if not in the narration? 

The answer is simple -- you do it via dialogue. 

If you want the reader to know something about the character’s background, or a key plot point, you do it in a conversation. 

For example, if a key plot point, in your book, required the main character to fly a plane, you would not put it in the narrative, you would put it in the conversation. The wrong way to do this would be for the narrator to TELL the reader the character could fly a plane. The correct way would be to SHOW the reader by having the topic come up naturally in conversation and then have he character admit they can fly a plane.

Let’s look at another example…

If you want the reader to know your main character is an expert in hand-to-hand combat then you are presented with two options.

The first would be to TELL the reader. This is the wrong way to pass the information. For example…

John had grown up in a tough city, where survival was more important than education. School life had been problematic and fights were part of everyday life. However, after one fateful day, when he had returned home with a black eye, John’s father had insisted his son should toughen up. From that day on John attended the local karate dojo training each day until he was an expert. 

 The second would be to SHOW the reader. This is the correct way and leaves the reader engaged and active. For example…

’You look pretty good, do you keep in shape?’ said Paula, eyeing John’s well-formed torso under his tight t-shirt. John smiled.

‘Yeah, but I am not a gym rat,’ John replied.

‘No? You must pump weights or something; you don’t get a body like that eating pizza and watching TV.’

John smiled. There was a pause. ‘I think the whole pumping iron thing is a bit weird.’

Paula’s eye scanned John’s body. ‘So what’s your thing?’

‘Martial arts.’

‘Ohh,’ there was a tone of surprise in Paula’s voice. ‘You any good?’

‘Yeah. Pretty good.’

‘How long you been training?’

‘Since I was a kid.’ 

John shifted in his chair and stared at Paula for moment, his fingers subconsciously touching his face. When he spoke again his voice was almost a whisper. 

‘I grew up in a bad area; there were fights at school every day. One day a gang of lads jumped me. I didn’t stand a chance; I was a wimp at the time. I was beaten up pretty bad. When my old man saw the state of my face he didn’t say a word, he simply grabbed me by the hand and took me to the martial arts dojo on the corner of our street. I had never been in before. My old man took me inside, had a quick word with the guy who ran the place and left me there. For the next ten years I would go every day after school and train. I even started to enjoy it.’

‘Sounds… interesting.’

‘Well I never came home with a black eye again.’

This example contains much than the back-story. The way John whispers the reply shows he is not comfortable with his past. I had decided his father had beaten John and John didn’t like talking about his past. I have added pauses to reflect John’s internal voice as he ‘filters’ what is said to Paula.

Any good story is made up of three elements:

1. A character’s internal voice.
2. A character’s external voice.
3. A character’s reaction to events.

This means whilst you are SHOWING back-story via dialogue and events, you can also build the character.

A character’s internal voice will be providing a ‘dialogue’ that reflects the characters thoughts. A reader will never ‘hear’ these. The external voice is what is reflected in the dialogue. This is shaped by the internal voice. 

For example, above I had decided that John had an internal voice that said ‘people who pumped iron where self-indulgent and lacked self-confidence’. This was reflected in his words. I never TOLD the reader this; I let it SHOW between the lines, so to speak. 

The final aspect is the way a character reacts to events. In our example, if a mugger confronted John he would probably fight back. I suspect he would also react badly to a bully.

The interest for a reader comes when the three elements (internal, external and actions), don’t match. In real life and in novels what people say, think and do are very different things.

So… if you short cut all of this and just TELL the reader, you have missed all the elements that make novels such great tools for telling stories and examining human behavior. 

So to summarize:

·      Plot and back-story is passed only via dialogue. 
·      Narration is only for description of actions, characters and locations.

One simple technique you can use in your writing is the camera test. Look at a scene in your book and imagine writing it with only the things a camera could see and record. Write as if you were the cameraman. 

### Underlining Thoughts
In contemporary writing, underlining thoughts is generally considered unnecessary and can be replaced with more subtle and effective techniques. Instead of relying on underlining to indicate a character's thoughts, you can use normal formatting while ensuring that attribution for thoughts remains clear and easy to understand. This approach helps maintain a clean and consistent visual style in the text while preserving the reader's immersion in the story.

To indicate a character's thoughts without underlining, simply integrate the thoughts into the narrative seamlessly. This can be done using italics or incorporating the thoughts into the surrounding prose. For instance, thoughts can be woven into the text as indirect thoughts, making them feel more natural and fluid. This approach allows the reader to easily discern the character's thoughts without the need for any special formatting.

When conveying a character's thoughts, clarity is key. Ensure that the attribution for thoughts is unambiguous and that the reader can easily understand who is thinking or speaking. This can be achieved through the use of dialogue tags or context cues, which help to indicate the source of the thoughts.

For example, instead of underlining a thought, you might write:

Jane watched the storm brewing outside, thinking, I hope my umbrella is in the car.

Or, you could use italics to indicate a direct thought:

Jane watched the storm brewing outside. I hope my umbrella is in the car, she thought.

In both cases, the attribution of the thought is clear, and there is no need to underline the text.
### Exclamation Marks
Avoid using exclamation marks; these are considered a sign of weak writing and are a form of showing rather than telling. Instead, trust the reader to pick up the context of the speech from the surrounding prose. By doing this, you will help them to engage more fully with your work. Therefore, I have replaced the exclamation marks, where possible, with more suitable punctuation.
### Then
You have a writer’s tick for the use of ‘then’. You will find that there is no need to use phrases such as ‘then’ to denote the passage of time. The reader will assume that each sentence represents the forward movement in time and that events occur sequentially; there is no need further to reinforce this by the overuse of ‘then’. I have replaced or removed the use of ‘then’ where possible. 
### Formatting Dialogue
Formatting dialogue correctly can trip up even the most talented writer. From the outside, it can appear that formatting dialogue is a black box of contradictory rules. The best way to explain the rules of formatting dialogue is to use an example…

Hi have you seen my cat said Bob. No said Bill I have no idea where your cat is. If you see my cat will you let me know questioned Bob looking sad. Of course replied Bill with a tone of concern.
#### Formatting Dialogue: New Speaker, New Line
This is a pretty easy rule to apply. Each time a new speaker speaks you place the line of dialogue on a new line. This line should also be indented. We can see how this applies to our example:

 Hi have you seen my cat said Bob.

No said Bill I have no idea where your cat is.

If you see my cat will you let me know questioned Bob looking sad.

Of course replied Bill with a tone of concern.
#### Formatting Dialogue: Adding Speech Marks
The next rule says that all speech should be placed in speech marks. These can be either single (‘) or double (“); it’s your choice. However, keep in mind that if you use, say single (‘), you need to be using the opposite, in this case double (“) when you are reporting speech inside speech. 

‘Hi have you seen my cat’ said Bob.

‘No’ said Bill ‘I have no idea where your cat is.’

‘If you see my cat will you let me know’ questioned Bob looking sad.

‘Of course’ replied Bill with a tone of concern.
#### Formatting Dialogue: Punctuation
When writing dialogue you will often use ‘tags’. These are verbs, which link the spoken words with the remainder of the sentence. Commonly used tags includes said, asked, replied and many more. Without going into the technical detail, to correctly punctuate spoken words and tags you must link them using a comma. If you use a full stop the sentences are broken and it no longer makes sense. If we look at the second line of our example we see:

 ‘No’ said Bill

 This is a single sentence and therefore must end with a full stop, giving us:

 ‘No’ said Bill.

 The tag in this sentence is ‘said’ and this must be connected to the speech. If you added a full stop at the end of the spoken words, it would separate the tag and become incorrect:

‘No.’ Said Bill. [WRONG]

Instead, we must link the spoken word and the tag with a comma, this gives us:

‘No,’ said Bill. [CORRECT]

 There’s one more tip. It is best to use ‘Bill said’, rather than ‘said Bill.’ After all you would write, ‘he said’, not ‘said he’.

 If we apply this to the full example we get:

 ‘Hi, have you seen my cat?’ Bob said.

‘No,’ Bill said. ‘I have no idea where your cat is.’

‘If you see my cat will you let me know?’ Bob questioned, looking sad.

‘Of course,’ Bill replied, with a tone of concern.

Please note that in the first and third lines we have used a ? instead of a , since it is a question.
### The Importance of Writing Dialogue in Full
In narrative writing, dialogue serves as a critical tool for revealing character, building tension, and engaging the reader. While summarizing dialogue in narrative summary may be tempting, writing dialogue in full offers several advantages that contribute to a richer and more immersive reading experience.

- Show, Don't Tell: Writing dialogue in full allows readers to experience the conversations between characters firsthand. This enables them to observe the characters' personalities, emotions, and motivations more directly, rather than having these aspects summarized or filtered through the narrative voice. By showing character interactions rather than telling, readers can form their own impressions and connections with the characters.
- Authenticity and Voice: Fully written dialogue provides an opportunity for the characters to express their unique voices, making them feel more genuine and relatable. Summarizing dialogue risks losing these individual nuances and can result in characters that feel flat or indistinguishable from one another. By crafting authentic dialogue, writers can create memorable and engaging characters that resonate with readers.
- Pacing and Tension: Dialogue can be a powerful tool for controlling the pace and tension within a story. When written in full, dialogue can create a sense of immediacy, propelling the story forward and drawing readers deeper into the narrative. In contrast, summarizing dialogue may slow down the pace and diminish the impact of critical moments or character interactions.
- Emotional Impact: Writing dialogue in full allows readers to witness the emotional dynamics between characters as they unfold. This can lead to a more intense and engaging reading experience, as readers become emotionally invested in the characters and their relationships. Summarizing dialogue may dilute these emotional connections and reduce the overall impact of the story.
- Subtext and Layered Meaning: Fully written dialogue offers opportunities for subtext, innuendo, and hidden meanings, inviting readers to read between the lines and interpret the characters' true intentions. This can create a more complex and thought-provoking narrative, whereas summarizing dialogue may oversimplify character interactions and rob readers of the opportunity to explore deeper meanings.

Writing dialogue in full is essential for creating vivid, engaging, and emotionally resonant narratives. By crafting authentic and meaningful character interactions, writers can enhance characterization, control pacing and tension, and provide readers with a more immersive and rewarding reading experience.
### Chapter Breaks
There were a few sections in your novel where I felt your chapter breaks were not working as well as they should. 

Determining when to start a new chapter in your manuscript is an important aspect of storytelling, as it can impact the pacing, structure, and overall reading experience. While there are no strict rules for when to begin a new chapter, several factors can help guide your decision-making process:

1. Change in Scene or Setting: One of the most common reasons to start a new chapter is when the story transitions to a new scene or setting. This provides a natural break in the narrative, allowing the reader to mentally reset and prepare for the next part of the story.
2. Shift in Time: A new chapter may be warranted when there's a significant time jump, either forward or backward, in the narrative. This helps to clearly signal to the reader that the story is moving to a different time period and prevents confusion.
3. Change in Point of View: If your story features multiple viewpoints or perspectives, it's often best to start a new chapter when switching between these different characters. This creates a clear delineation between the various perspectives and ensures that the reader can easily follow the narrative's shifts in focus.
4. Pacing and Tension: Chapters can be used to control the pacing and tension within your story. Shorter chapters often create a sense of urgency and can propel the narrative forward, while longer chapters may allow for more in-depth exploration of a specific event or character development. Consider starting a new chapter when you want to adjust the pacing or build tension in your story.
5. Emotional Impact: A new chapter can be used to heighten the emotional impact of a particular scene or event. By ending a chapter on a cliffhanger, revelation, or emotionally charged moment, you can leave the reader eager to continue and discover what happens next.
6. Thematic Breaks: If your story is divided into distinct sections or explores different themes, it can be helpful to start a new chapter when transitioning between these elements. This can create a sense of structure and organization within the narrative, helping the reader to better understand and process the story's various components.

Ultimately, deciding when to start a new chapter is a subjective process that depends on your unique storytelling style and the specific needs of your manuscript. By considering the factors outlined above, you can make informed decisions about when to begin a new chapter, creating a well-structured and engaging narrative that resonates with your readers.

### Killing off Parents
I did wonder if it would be beneficial for you to have the main character’s parents die at the start of the book. I suggest this for two reasons. The first is that it gives him additional motivation to seek revenge and leaves him with no reason to stay at home. The second is that this will fit the the trope of the hero’s journey, where the main character is protected into a new unstable world by the destrcutvion of his current ‘safe’ world.

## Chapter Feedback
In the following section of this comprehensive report, we present a detailed assessment of the novel, chapter by chapter. Our objective is to provide the author with an in-depth analysis that will not only identify possible problems and areas for improvement but also highlight the strengths and successes of each chapter.

This feedback will vary in length and content, as each chapter may present unique challenges and opportunities. While our analysis will focus on specific aspects such as plot development, character progression, pacing, and style, it is important to remember that this evaluation should be used in conjunction with the discussion of general issues found elsewhere in the report.

By examining each chapter individually, we aim to create a holistic understanding of the novel's overall structure, narrative arc, and the interplay between its various components. This granular approach will equip the author with the necessary insights and recommendations to refine and elevate their manuscript to its fullest potential

### Prologue
This is a good opening chapter. I felt the use of description was good, and you strike a nice balance between world-building and info-dumping. It's always a worry that you will feed too much information into the reader with this type of novel, but this is not the case, and you are letting the story unfold. 

One thing to watch out for is small sections that seem cliched. You have people in the crowd crying. This felt a little too much and should be pulled back to something more realistic. When did you last see this type of adoration in real life? It's very rare. Perhaps look at how the Trump crowds reacted during his early speeches to see what this type of blind faith looks like in reality.
