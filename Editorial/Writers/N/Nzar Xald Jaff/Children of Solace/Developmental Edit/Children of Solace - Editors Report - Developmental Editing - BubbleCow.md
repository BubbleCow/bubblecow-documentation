## Understanding Your Feedback
Before I launch into more detailed feedback, I thought I’d review how the edit has been structured.

You will have downloaded two files:
1.    The edited manuscript.
2.    The editor’s report.

The first is your original manuscript but now contains detailed editorial notes. This is a Word document and contains both comments and tracked changes. If you don’t use Word, don’t worry; most modern word processing packages have the ability to ‘read’ Word manuscripts. Alternatively, you can download this excellent word processing software for free - [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/). If you are having problems seeing your feedback, just let us know.

Before you dive into the edit, I think it will help if you understand the ethos behind BubbleCow’s approach to providing feedback.

The approach is to provide clear and truthful feedback. If we see a problem, this will not only be highlighted. But at least one potential solution is provided. There are two types of feedback, those based on clear editorial best practices (e.g., showing, not telling) and those based on the editor's opinion. When a suggestion is based on opinion, it will be indicated. We see the edited manuscript's role in offering specific, actionable feedback on sentence/paragraph problems. You should be able to apply the suggestions made on a line-by-line basis without any real wider knowledge.

The role of the editor’s report is to provide a wider overview of the editing process. This means that if we have made changes to the manuscript that require a deeper rationale, these have been outlined and explained in the report. 

One way to consider the two documents is to see the report as the wider instructions and the manuscript as the practical application. You should be able to start each editing session by reading the editor’s report before diving into the specific section of the manuscript. 
### Using Tracked Changes
Tracked changes are like magic. Once they are turned on, they record everything that happens to your manuscript. You then can go in and ‘accept’ or ‘reject’ the changes as you see fit. 

The way the tracked changes appear on your machine will vary depending on your machine and software setup. Typically, they will show the original text removed in red and the new text replacing it in black. However, depending on your settings, this will sometimes be the case. For example, in manuscripts requiring a large number of alterations, it is common for an editor to ‘turn off’ the original text and only show the changes. 

If you are having problems seeing the tracked changes, the first place to look is your settings; the two important elements are: ‘simple markup’ and ‘all markup’. If using Word, I suggest you look in the ‘review’ section of the ribbon at the top of your manuscript and ensure that you have set the markup to ‘all markup’. This way, you can see all the possible changes. 

The video below will give you a more in-depth view of tracked changes and comments: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUf-IxzXyVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUf-IxzXyVk)
### Edited Manuscript
When you first open the edited manuscript, you may feel overwhelmed by the number of alterations. This is normal. 

The manuscript contains my tracked changes and comments explaining the rationale behind these changes. In some cases, I’ve re-written passages or removed whole sections, but where I’ve done so, I’ve sought to explain my thinking using comments. Where possible, I have also highlighted sections I feel work well.

The real power of tracked changes is that if you disagree with the comment or change, you can just ‘reject’ what I’ve said and carry on.

Whenever I’ve identified a persistent problem, I’ve stopped explaining any future changes within the comments and have just made the change instead. Where this is the case, I have written an explanation for my rationale behind the changes in the editor’s report. You’ll need to read the comments I’ve left and review the changes, accepting or rejecting them as you see fit.
### Editor’s Report
The editor’s report should be read first and is designed to ease you into the editing process by providing an overview and explanation. The aim is for you to use the feedback in both the manuscript and this report as a means of formulating a plan to elevate your manuscript to the next level. 

I’ve split the report into several sections...
#### Typographical and Stylistic Summary
You’ll find a summary of your book’s typographical and stylistic details, which lists things such as what form of English your book is written in, how you’re writing out times, whether you’re using the Oxford comma or not, etc. This section is useful as it collates information and is a future reference. It will also help you enforce a level of consistency in your book.
#### Strengths and Weaknesses
You’ll find pointers that will give you an overview of what I think are the manuscript’s key strengths and weaknesses. If they’re turning up here, they are some of the manuscript’s biggest and most persistent problems and will need addressing before any others. I explain the problem, how it is manifested in your book, and why it is a problem. I’ll also suggest at least one possible solution.
#### Chapter Feedback
This section contains feedback specific to each chapter. The depth and detail of this feedback will vary depending on the issues encountered. This feedback is designed to be actionable but should also be read in conjugated with more general feedback and embedded notes in your manuscript. 

Please note: I’ve approached your book from the point of view of a new reader. This means that I may comment early on but then change my mind. This should give you a good indication of how a reader will be responding to the story and any confusion they may have. It should also help you to see my thinking process. Feedback has indicated that this can be very helpful for some authors.

#### Summary
Please remember that all the comments and changes come from a place of support, not criticism. I want to make the book the best it can be, as you do. I’m not here to cast judgment or project my own preferences. My role is to help nudge your writing style toward a place that will create the best possible reading experience. 

Our goal is to produce better books and better writers.

Finally, once you delve into the feedback, I’d suggest you read the notes and then take a day or two to absorb what I’ve suggested. If you disagree with any changes, that’s fine, but please do take a little time to think them over before getting back to me. If, after this ‘cooling-off period’ you have any questions or comments, please don’t hesitate to email me at gary@bubblecow.com.

## Notes on the Edited Manuscript
Below is a list of general comments about your manuscript. 

Please note that many of these changes have been made to help in the eBook conversion process. This process often involves using the original manuscript’s formatting to help ‘set’ the formatting of the eBook. However, this can be problematic. I have, therefore, made some changes to help negate any potential future issues. 

- I’ve run a basic spelling and grammar check. I’ve carefully made the alterations I felt were needed. This is not a proofread but will add some level of consistency to your book.
- I have replaced double spaces with single spaces. This was to eliminate any unwanted ‘white space’, which is often removed during the eBook conversion process.
- I’ve set the line spacing to 1.5 lines. This helps with readability.
- I’ve added page breaks at the end of chapters. This will help with digital conversion.
- Ellipses have been formatted as … (dot dot dot), not . . . (dot space dot space dot space). 
- I have used page breaks to separate chapters. This will make formatting the book into a digital format easier at a later date.
## Stylistic and Typographical Summary
Below is a list of changes that have been made to help with readability and add consistency. 
### Language
> [!info] 
> American English
> British English
### Numeric Notation 
Spell out whole numbers up to (and including) one hundred (e.g., zero, one, ten, ninety-six, 104). Spell out numbers that begin a sentence unless it begins with a year (e.g., "Twelve drummers," "The ten lords a-leaping," "2011's quota for off-season holiday references has been filled."). 

Spell out ordinal numbers up to (and including) "hundredth" (e.g., second, sixty-first, 333rd, 1,024th). 

If you're juggling a bunch of numbers within the same paragraph or series of paragraphs, be flexible with the number style if doing so will improve clarity and comprehension. For example, use one number style for items in one category and another style for another category: "I read four books with more than 400 pages, sixty books with more than 100 pages, and a hundred articles with less than 4 pages."

### Speech Marks
> [!info] 
> Double for direct, single for reported. 
> Single for direct, double for reported.

### Oxford Comma
> [!info] 
> Yes.
> No

### Narrative Perspective
First-person.

## Strengths and Weaknesses
This section contains specific feedback about elements of your book that are immediately actionable. I have strived not only to explain any problems I have encountered but also to provide at least one solution you can apply to your book. 

### Indentation
In crafting a well-presented manuscript, understanding paragraph indentation is crucial. Indentation serves not just a functional purpose in delineating paragraphs but also plays an aesthetic role, enhancing readability and providing visual cues to the reader. However, there's a nuanced exception to the rule of indentation that is often overlooked but is paramount for maintaining a professional appearance in your writing: the first paragraph of each chapter should be flush with the left margin, while subsequent paragraphs should be indented.
#### The Rule of Indentation
Generally, the first line of each paragraph in a manuscript is indented by about 0.5 inches. This indentation signals the beginning of a new paragraph to the reader, making the text easier to follow. The uniformity of indentation throughout the manuscript ensures consistency, which is key to a visually appealing document.
#### Exception: The First Paragraph of Each Chapter
The first paragraph of each chapter, however, breaks from this general rule. This paragraph should not be indented but rather should start flush with the left margin. This stylistic choice serves multiple purposes:

- **Visual Cue**: The lack of indentation at the beginning of a chapter acts as a visual marker, clearly signaling to the reader that they are embarking on a new section of the narrative.
- **Tradition and Conformity**: This formatting convention aligns with traditional publishing standards. Adhering to this norm not only makes your manuscript more professional but also shows your familiarity with the industry's expectations.
- **Aesthetic Appeal**: Starting the first paragraph flush with the margin sets the tone for the chapter. It provides a clean and crisp opening, contributing to the overall aesthetic and readability of the text.
#### Applying the Rule
When formatting your manuscript, ensure that each chapter adheres to this rule. After the initial, non-indented paragraph, revert to the standard indentation for the subsequent paragraphs within the chapter. This approach creates a rhythm and structure that readers intuitively understand, even if they are not consciously aware of it.
#### Practical Tips
- **Consistency is Key**: Apply this rule uniformly across all chapters to maintain a cohesive look throughout your manuscript.
- **Use Styles and Templates**: Most word processors allow you to set up styles or templates. Utilize these features to automate the indentation process, ensuring consistency and saving time during document formatting.
- **Review Examples**: Examine published books within your genre to see how this rule is applied in practice. Notice how the non-indented first paragraph of each chapter contributes to the overall presentation of the text.

By understanding and applying the principle of non-indentation for the first paragraph of each chapter, you ensure that your manuscript meets professional standards, enhancing its readability and visual appeal. This subtle but important detail marks your manuscript with the hallmark of professionalism, signaling to readers and publishers alike that you are versed in the nuances of book formatting.

The art of description in narrative writing serves as the bridge between the writer's imagination and the reader's perception, allowing the vivid scenes, characters, and settings conceived by the author to come alive in the reader's mind. The importance of description cannot be overstated, as it is the vehicle by which readers are invited to visualize the unfolding story, making the fictional world as real and palpable as the world outside their window.

### Painting the Scene in the Reader's Mind
As readers journey through a story, they are constantly engaged in an act of creation, painting pictures of scenes, characters, and settings in their mind's eye. This imaginative process is guided and shaped by the writer's descriptive prowess. To facilitate this visualization, the writer must provide sufficient and evocative description, offering the colors, shapes, and textures needed for the reader to construct a vivid tableau of the narrative landscape. It is through this descriptive lens that readers experience the emotional and sensory depth of the story, making each moment immersive and real.
#### The Depth of Description for Characters and Locations
Each new character or location introduced in a story warrants a layer of description that not only defines their appearance but also gives insight into their essence or the atmosphere of the place. The more pivotal the character or location to the story's progression, the more nuanced and layered the description should be. This doesn't mean that every detail must be exhaustively cataloged, but rather that the details provided should be meaningful and revealing, contributing to the reader's understanding and emotional connection to the character or setting.
#### Updating Descriptions with Changes
As characters evolve and settings change within the narrative, so too should the descriptions that accompany them. This dynamic approach to description ensures that the reader's understanding and mental imagery remain aligned with the story's developments. Changes in a character's appearance, demeanor, or circumstances, as well as shifts in a location's atmosphere or significance, should be mirrored by updated descriptions, keeping the reader fully engaged and informed.
#### Grounding Each Chapter or Scene
Incorporating descriptive sections at the outset of each chapter or scene is vital for grounding the reader in the narrative's current moment and space. These descriptive passages serve as the foundation for the action and dialogue that follow, setting the tone and establishing the context. By vividly painting the initial backdrop, the writer ensures that the reader is mentally and emotionally prepared for the ensuing developments, fully immersed in the story's unfolding reality.
#### The Art of Balancing Description
While the necessity of description is clear, the art lies in achieving a balance—providing enough detail to enrich the reader's imagination and emotional experience without overwhelming or slowing the narrative pace. Effective description is not merely about the quantity of details but the quality and relevance of those chosen, highlighting the writer's skill in creating a world that readers can effortlessly enter and inhabit with each turn of the page.

In sum, description is the magic that transforms written words into vivid, living scenes in the reader's mind, making it a crucial element of storytelling. Through skillful and thoughtful description, writers invite readers into the heart of the narrative, offering them a seat at the table of imagination where every scene is witnessed, every character becomes familiar, and every location is visited, all within the boundless landscape of the reader's mind.

In crafting narrative descriptions, particularly those involving sensory details like sound, the inclination might be to lean towards onomatopoeia or directly imitating sounds within the text. However, there's a nuanced approach to integrating sounds into your narrative effectively without resorting to directly describing them, especially when aiming to maintain the elegance and flow of your prose. The decision to refrain from spelling out sounds, choosing instead to describe their effect or role in the scene, can elevate your writing in several key ways.

### Creating an Atmosphere, Not a Transcript
The primary aim of describing sounds in your writing should be to contribute to the atmosphere or emotional tone of the scene rather than to provide a transcript of the auditory experience. In the example provided, removing the direct imitation of the cricket sounds shifts the focus from the specific noises to the overall ambiance they create. This subtle change can make the description more immersive and evocative. It invites readers to draw from their own experiences and imaginations to fill in the auditory details, making the scene more personal and resonant for each individual.
#### Encouraging Imagination and Engagement
When readers encounter a direct representation of a sound in text, such as “chirp…chirp…chirp,” it can disrupt their flow of reading and limit their imaginative engagement with the story. Describing the effect of the sound instead leaves room for the readers to engage their senses and memories, allowing them to hear the crickets in their mind's unique way. This approach fosters a deeper and more interactive form of reader engagement, where the soundscapes of the narrative become a collaborative creation between the writer and the reader.
#### Maintaining Literary Elegance
Directly described sounds can often feel out of place in the prose, breaking the literary illusion with a stark reminder of the text's physicality. By focusing on the effect or presence of a sound within the narrative context, you maintain the elegance and fluidity of your writing style. This method weaves sensory details seamlessly into the fabric of your story, enriching the narrative without jarring the reader out of their immersion.
#### Enhancing Emotional Resonance
Sounds have a profound ability to evoke emotions and memories, a power that is best harnessed through suggestive and evocative descriptions rather than literal interpretations. By describing the emotional or atmospheric impact of a sound, you tap into the broader palette of the reader's experiences and emotional responses. This approach allows for a more nuanced and layered emotional resonance within the scene, enriching the reader's connection to the narrative.
#### Fostering Universality and Relatability
The direct imitation of sounds in writing can sometimes alienate readers who are unfamiliar with the specific noise being described or who may interpret it differently based on their cultural or personal background. Describing the impact or ambiance created by a sound, on the other hand, fosters a more universal and relatable experience. It acknowledges the subjective nature of sensory perception, welcoming a wider audience into the narrative world.

In conclusion, while the sounds of your narrative world are crucial in bringing it to life, the technique of describing their essence rather than directly imitating them enriches your storytelling. It enhances atmospheric depth, engages the reader’s imagination, and preserves the literary quality of your work, making your narrative a more inclusive and immersive experience.

### Avoid Adverbs
Adverbs, those words typically ending in "-ly" that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, have long been a point of contention in the art of writing. While they can add specificity or emphasis to a sentence, overuse or reliance on adverbs is often seen as a hallmark of weak writing. Here’s why a judicious approach to adverbs can elevate the quality of your prose:
#### 1. **Encourages Stronger Verbs**
The primary critique against adverbs is that they can act as crutches, allowing writers to use weaker verbs. For example, “she ran quickly” can be replaced with “she sprinted,” providing a more vivid and direct description of the action. By avoiding adverbs, writers are challenged to seek out stronger, more descriptive verbs that convey action and emotion more effectively, thus enhancing the reader's experience by showing rather than telling.
#### 2. **Improves Clarity and Precision**
Adverbs can sometimes introduce vagueness into a sentence. “He spoke loudly” leaves room for interpretation—was he shouting, calling out across a distance, or perhaps speaking over noise? A more precise description removes ambiguity: “He shouted to be heard over the din.” By avoiding adverbs, writers can explore more precise and evocative ways to express action, mood, and intensity.
#### 3. **Enhances Immediacy and Impact**
Narratives thrive on the immediacy of their scenes, pulling readers into the moment. Adverbs, by modifying the intensity or manner of an action, can dilute this immediacy, adding a layer of separation between the action and the reader’s experience. Choosing stronger, more direct language in place of adverbs enhances the impact of your writing, making scenes more vivid and engaging.
#### 4. **Reduces Redundancy**
Adverbs often tell what’s already shown, leading to redundancy. If a character slams a door, adding “angrily” might be unnecessary—the action itself conveys the emotion. Removing the adverb encourages readers to infer emotions and motivations from the characters’ actions, fostering a deeper engagement with the narrative.
#### 5. **Streamlines Writing**
Adverbs can clutter sentences, making them longer and more complicated than necessary. Streamlined writing is often more powerful and easier to read. Cutting unnecessary adverbs helps to tighten prose, making it more impactful and enjoyable for the reader.
#### 6. **Fosters Show, Don’t Tell**
“Show, don’t tell” is a foundational principle of effective writing. Adverbs often tell the reader how to feel or interpret an action, rather than showing them through context, action, and dialogue. By avoiding adverbs, writers can create a richer, more immersive experience that invites readers to draw their own conclusions about characters and events.
#### Balancing Act
While the advice to avoid adverbs can help tighten prose and enhance clarity, it’s important to recognize that adverbs are not inherently bad. They can be effective when used sparingly and with purpose, adding rhythm, emphasis, or nuance to a sentence in ways that other constructions might not. The key is to use them judiciously, ensuring that each adverb adds clear, specific value to your writing.
### Show, Don't Tell
The principle of "show, don't tell" is a cornerstone of effective storytelling, guiding writers to present their narrative in a way that allows readers to experience the story through actions, words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's exposition and description. This technique fosters a deeper emotional connection to the story, engaging readers by encouraging them to draw their own conclusions and immerse themselves in the narrative world.
#### The Importance of Showing Not Telling
"Showing" involves using descriptive language to help the reader visualize scenes and understand emotions implicitly through the characters' actions and the environment, rather than directly stating facts or feelings. This method makes the story more vivid and engaging, as readers are active participants, using their imagination to infer and visualize the narrative. It enhances the depth of the reading experience, making characters more relatable and scenes more palpable.
#### The Power of Sensory Details
Incorporating sensory details is a key aspect of showing. By engaging the five senses—sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch—writers can create a rich, immersive world. Sensory details bring scenes to life, allowing readers to feel as though they are part of the story, experiencing events alongside the characters.
#### Example: Telling vs. Showing
**Telling**: John was very tired after his long journey. He felt sad to be back in his old town, which made him remember his unhappy childhood.

**Showing**: John dragged his feet up the steps to his childhood home, his shoulders slumped under the weight of his backpack and the heavier burden of returning. The familiar creak of the door echoed through the silent hall, a ghostly reminder of days he'd rather forget. He tossed his keys onto the table with a sigh, the sound lost in the vast emptiness of the house that had once been filled with laughter, now only whispers of a past long gone.

In the "telling" example, the reader is simply informed about John's state of mind and feelings about his town and childhood. It's direct and straightforward but lacks emotional depth and engagement.

In the "showing" example, the same information is conveyed through John's actions, the environment, and sensory details. The reader can infer John's tiredness from his dragging feet, his feelings about his return from his body language and the sigh, and his unhappy childhood from the description of the house. This version invites readers to empathize with John, to feel his weariness and sense of loss.
#### Balancing Show and Tell
While "show, don't tell" is a powerful technique, it's important to balance showing with telling. Not every detail or emotion needs to be shown through elaborate descriptions; strategic telling can help maintain pace and clarity, especially in complex plots or when conveying straightforward information that doesn't benefit from detailed imagery.

Effective storytelling often involves a dance between showing and telling, with the writer guiding the reader through the narrative by revealing just enough to keep the pages turning. By mastering this balance, writers can create stories that captivate and resonate, leaving lasting impressions on their readers.
