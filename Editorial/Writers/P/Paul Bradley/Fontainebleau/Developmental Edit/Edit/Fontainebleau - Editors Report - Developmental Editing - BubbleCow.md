## Understanding Your Feedback

Before I launch into more detailed feedback, I thought I’d run through how the edit has been structured.

You will have downloaded two files:

1.    The edited manuscript.
2.    The editor’s report.

The first is your original manuscript but now contains detailed editorial notes. The second is this file, which contains the thoughts of your editor. 

These are Word documents and contain both comments and tracked changes. If you don’t use Word, don’t worry; most modern word processing packages have the ability to ‘read’ Word manuscripts. 

If you are having problems opening your files, you can download this excellent word processing software for free - [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).

Before you dive into the edit I think it will help if you understand the ethos behind BubbleCow’s approach to providing feedback. 

We see the role of the edited manuscript to be that it offers specific, actionable feedback on a sentence/paragraph level problems. You should be able to apply the suggestions made on a line-by-line basis, without any real wider knowledge.

The role of the editor’s report is to provide a wider overview of the editing process. This means that if we have made changes to the manuscript that require a deeper rationale, these have been outlined and explained in the report. 

One way to consider the two documents is to see the report as the wider instructions and the manuscript as the practical application. You should be able to start each editing session by reading the editor’s report, before diving into the specific section of the manuscript. 
### Using Tracked Changes

If you are comfortable with comments and tracked changes, then you can jump ahead to the next section (‘Edited Manuscript’).

Tracked changes are like magic. Once they are turned on, they record everything that happens to your manuscript. You then have the power to go in and accept or reject the changes as you see fit. 

Comments are the little ‘speech’ bubbles that appear on the side of your manuscript. These allow your editor to add their thoughts and, in the process, allow you to ‘see’ the editing process. 

The video below will give you a more in-depth view of tracked changes and comments.

### Edited Manuscript
When you first open the edited manuscript, you may feel overwhelmed by the number of alterations. This is normal. 

The manuscript contains both my tracked changes and comments explaining the rationale behind these changes. In some cases, I’ve re-written passages or removed whole sections, but where I’ve done so I’ve sought to explain my thinking using comments. Where possible, I have also highlighted sections I feel work well.

The real power of tracked changes is that if you disagree with the comment or change, you can just ‘reject’ what I’ve said and carry on.

Whenever I’ve identified a persistent problem, I’ve stopped explaining any future changes within the comments and have instead just made the change. Where this is the case, I have written out an explanation for my rationale behind the changes in the editor’s report. You’ll need to read the comments I’ve left and review the changes, accepting or rejecting them as you see fit.

### Editor’s Report
The editor’s report should be read first, and is designed to ease you into the editing process by providing an overview and explanation. The aim is for you to use the feedback in both the manuscript and in this report as a means of formulating a plan to elevate your manuscript to the next level. 

I’ve split the report into several sections...
#### Typographical and Stylistic Details
You’ll find a summary of your book’s typographical and stylistic details, which lists things such as what form of English your book is written in, how you’re writing out times, whether you’re using the Oxford comma or not, etc. This section is useful as it collates information and serves as a future reference. It will also help you enforce a level of consistency on your book.

#### Strengths and Weaknesses
You’ll also find pointers that will give you an overview of what I think are the manuscript’s key strengths and weaknesses. If they’re turning up here, they are some of the manuscript’s biggest and most persistent problems, and will need addressing before any others. I’ll explain what the problem is, how it is manifested in your book, and why it is a problem. I’ll also suggest at least one possible solution.

Please note: I’ve approached your book from the point of view of a new reader. This means that I may make a comment early on but then later change my mind. This should give you a good indication of how a reader will be responding to the story and any confusions he/she may have. It should also help you to see my thinking process. Feedback has indicated that this can be very helpful for some writers.

Please remember that all the comments and changes come from a place of support, not criticism. I want to make the book the best it can be, as you do. I’m not here to cast judgement or project my own preferences. In fact, my role is to help nudge your writing style towards a place that will create the best possible reading experience. 

Our goal is to produce better books and better writers.

Finally, once you delve into the feedback, I’d suggest you read the notes and then take a day or two to absorb what I’ve suggested. If you disagree with any changes, that’s fine but please do take a little time to think them over before getting back to me. If after this cool-off period you have any questions or comments, please don’t hesitate to email me at gary@bubblecow.com.
## Notes on the Edited Manuscript

Below is a list of general comments about your manuscript. 

Please note, many of these changes have been made to help in the eBook conversion process. This process often involves the use of the original manuscript’s formatting to help ‘set’ the formatting of the eBook. However, this can be problematic. I have, therefore, made some changes to help negate any potential future issues. 

- I’ve run a basic spelling and grammar check. I’ve carefully made the alterations I felt were needed. This is not a proofread, but will add some level of consistency to your book.
- I have replaced double spaces with single spaces. This was to eliminate any unwanted ‘white space’, which is often removed during the eBook conversion process.
- I’ve set the line spacing to 1.5 lines. This helps with readability.
- I’ve added page breaks at the end of chapters. This will help with digital conversion.
- Ellipses have been formatted as … (dot dot dot), not . . . (dot space dot space dot space). 
## Stylistic and Typographical Summary

Below is a list of changes that have been made to help with readability and add consistency. 
### Language

> [!warning]
> American English
> British English
### Numeric Notation 
Spell out whole numbers up to (and including) one hundred (e.g., zero, one, ten, ninety-six, 104). Spell out numbers that begin a sentence unless it begins with a year (e.g., "Twelve drummers," "The ten lords a-leaping," "2011's quota for off-season holiday references has been filled."). 

Spell out ordinal numbers up to (and including) "hundredth" (e.g., second, sixty-first, 333rd, 1,024th). 

If you're juggling a bunch of numbers within the same paragraph or series of paragraphs, be flexible with the number style if doing so will improve clarity and comprehension. For example, use one number style for items in one category and another style for another category: "I read four books with more than 400 pages, sixty books with more than 100 pages, and a hundred articles with less than 4 pages."

### Speech Marks
> [!warning]
> Double for direct, single for reported. 
> Single for direct, double for reported
### Oxford Comma
> [!warning]
> Yes.
> No.

## Chapter Feedback
This section contains specific feedback about your chapters. This feedback is in addition to the Specific Feedback.  
### Chapter 1 
- I have made some alteration to the opening section of this chapter. I have tightened the information and tried to pull the reader into the story.  
- I wanted you to say something about just how important a collection of records was to the DJ business at the time. Only by having a good collection where you able to ensure that you could do a good job. This is not, of course, the case now where DJs can just plug in Spotify. 
### Chapter 2
- I have moved the star of this chapter to the end of the previous chapter. I think it reads better. 
- I wanted you to mention something about the growing trend towards package holidays. Buying the hotel might have seems crazy in the short term, but it was certainly benefiting on a growing trend. The next ten, or so, years would see holidays in Spain becoming common for the aspirational working class of Maggie's Britain. 
### Chapter 3
- I liked this chapter. The section at the end of the chapter works better in narrative non-fiction than it would have in fiction. It is now the narrator simply telling the reader the history of the town, this is much more inline with the reader's expectations.
### Chapter 4
- This is the first time we see the hotel. The thing is that the hotel is almost like a character in the book and, therefore, needs sufficient description. I wanted you to try and layer in as much description as possible in this chapter. This will establish the hotel and give you an image to build on in the future chapters. 
- The interactions between the brothers is much clearer now. In the first version, it was never clear that they have previously fallen out. 
### Chapter 5
- This chapter opens in the bar, this is a chance to establish what the bar looks like and layer in more description. 
### Chapter 6
- The opening of this chapter is the perfect example of where you can build more of a picture of the hotel. In this case, you can create an image of the dining room. These's also a little bit later where you can layer in more description. 
### Chapter 7 and 8
- Good chapters with solid storytelling, nothing new to add. 
### Chapter 9
- I think this chapter works really well. You have managed to capture a very particular type of person from the British working class of that time. 
### Chapter 10
- I wanted you to make more of the initial interaction between the Wings guy and the chef. You should describe how they are acting without any explanation. You need to let the reader work it out and slowly twig that there's a growing relationship. 
### Chapter 11
- At the start of this chapter you talk about becoming more efficient. This is good, however, I wanted you to show the reader rather than tell them. Describe the new layout and, perhaps, new equipment, show the reader how they were becoming more professional. 
### Chapter 12
- The hotel is a character in your book. It needs to be ever present. The start of this chapter is a good example of where you need to add more detail to the location of the hotel. This will allow the reader to picture the scene more clearly and really cement the image of the hotel in their mind's eye. 
### Chapter 13 & 14

- Good chapters, nothing to add. 
### Chapter 15
- This is the first chapter that you hint at money being a potential issue for the hotel. This is something that was developed in the novel but it not present in this version. See my editor's note above.  
### Chapter 16
- This is a the first chapter where you fit the finances head on. However, as you will see from my editor's note, I think that you should make it clearer to the reader that money is an issue. I don't think that you need to say outright that finances are a problems in earlier chapters, but I do feel that you need to mention two or three times that the hotel is struggling to break even. This will create a low level tension and then allow this chapter to have a greater impact. 
### Chapter 17
- Good chapter. I think it might have been good to have the dad say something like - 'if business fails to pick up soon we will all be heading back to England.'
### Chapter 18
- I have noticed that you often use 'said' when asking questions in dialogue. This should be 'asked'. I have changed this when i find it but keep an eye out in later rereads.
### Chapter 19
- Good chapter, nothing to add. 
### Chapter 20
- There's a moment in this chapter where you move between scenes but don't add any new location or character description. You don't need much but you do need some to allow the reader to adjust. 
### Chapter 21 and 22
- Good chapters with nothing to add. 
### Chapter 23
- This is good but remember any non-English speech should be in italics. I have altered this in this chapter. This is something to keep in mind for rereads etc. 
### Chapter 24
- I wanted you to open the chapter with a better description of the writer. He has only been in one scene and I wanted you to remind the reader about the character and his appearance.
### Chapter 25
- Good chapter. There's a few places where you need to put the Spanish words into italics.
### Chapter 26
- You need to add a better character description of Lucia, she's an important character. 
- Ensure that you are putting Spanish in italics. 
### Chapter 27
- This is the one of the few chances you get to describe the village, add a more detailed description. 
### Chapter 28
- Good chapter. I always like when you saw insights into the local culture and habits. I think these things are fascinating to the reader, especially an English reader.
## Chapter 29
- I loved the insight into a Spanish celebration but the crash back to reality with the sale of the Rolls at the end of the chapter works really well. 
### Chapter 30
- Good chapter. 
### Chapter 31
- Be careful with the capatilsation of Dad.  
### Chapter 32
- In the previous chapters, you are talking about money being a problem, but, suddenly, in this chapter the debt is repaid. What changed? 
### Chapter 33
- Good chapter.
### Chapter 34
- I think that you are ok in most of this chapter with minimal description. However, when he goes to the bathroom to fix a problem you need to layer in better description to allow the reader to picture the scene.
