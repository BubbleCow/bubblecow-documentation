## Original
As the nineteen-year-old youngest son of a reasonably well-heeled London bookie, I’d lived a charmed life without having to lift many fingers. A beautiful riverside house, plenty of pocket money, an annual cruise, regular holidays and being driven around in a Rolls Royce, did wonders for my ego but provided little preparation for my own path through life. Was I worried? No, my dad had it all worked out.

How could I question his plan or disagree with his opinions on how the world worked when the fruits of his hard work were laid bare before me on a daily basis. Surely, the route to my own happiness and personal growth was to go with the flow. When the ominous shadow of a Labour Government and their promise to fleece Britain’s wealthy loomed ominously ahead of us, it was only logical to follow his suggestion to sell up and go live in Spain? Life in a year-round warm climate promised infinitely more fulfilling opportunities for me than a crowded, cold, grey island.

Aside from protecting their wealth, my parents’ principal objective was to retire and enjoy the sunshine. However, to provide an income stream and a future for my brother and myself, dad was prepared to invest in a hotel business and help us build it up before heading off with mum to sharpen his gardening skills.

After selling his chain of betting shops and our main home we loaded up the Rolls and headed south. With my father’s successful track record in business how could we fail? I had not a single doubt that I would be equally successful, marry a lovely girl, buy my own luxury car, and enjoy an amazing life by the blue Mediterranean.

However, I didn’t have much to bring to the table.

My knowledge of Spanish culture, language, people or running a business in a country controlled by a ruthless dictator was practically zilch. I was naïve enough to think this wouldn’t matter.

All I could offer, apart from being an avid fan of Formula One with an exhaustive knowledge of sixties and seventies sounds, was a sharp mind, a quick tongue, some bar experience, and a willing attitude to turn my hand to whatever dad thought might be necessary.

The Spanish miracle that had fuelled rapid annual growth of over six percent between 1959 and 1974, particularly in the automotive industry was fading rapidly. The reliance on imported oil had ramped up inflation but while Franco lived, the rest of the world viewed Spain as a pariah state. With little to no inward investment, his government would have to look elsewhere for foreign currency or run out of fuel.

In this respect El Caudillo, Warlord, as they called him, was smart. Tourism had kicked off on the Costa Brava and Marbella in the 1960s. In the 1970s, it was encouraged to expand rapidly. New airlines emerged to transport masses of North European package holidaymakers to hastily expanded airfields in Barcelona, Alicante, Almeria, and Malaga. On the coasts, Spain appeared to be booming. The timing for our hotel venture had to be perfect.

The reality inland was a different picture. Unemployment was rife and the economy shrinking propped up only by tourist spending. When Franco died in 1975, the country was in dire straits with nobody knowing for sure which direction it would go. More autocratic rule or a switch back to democracy? This lack of clarity had an immediate effect on our business as Tour companies sat on the fence waiting to see where Spain would go. But we had burned our boats, we had no choice but to knuckle down, face the challenges head on and despite haemorrhaging cash, somehow make it work.

The ominous shadow of a Labour Government and their promise to fleece Britain’s wealthy loomed ominously ahead of us. So, when he suggested we sell up and move to Spain, it seemed logical. The year-round warm climate promised to be infinitely more fulfilling than a crowded, cold, grey island. 

After selling his chain of betting shops and our main home, we loaded up the Rolls and headed south. With my father’s successful track record in business, how could we fail?

Yet, this transition to the sun-drenched Costa del Sol was not without its perils. The language and culture, so different from our own, they presented not just challenges but potentially dangers misunderstandings.

My parents’ principal objective was to retire and enjoy the sunshine. However, to provide an income stream and a future for my brother and myself, Dad invested in a hotel business with the goal of showing us the ropes before heading off with mum to sharpen his gardening skills. 

This venture into the unknown turned out to be  fraught with more difficulties than we could have ever guessed, from navigating a foreign administrative system that seemed designed to fail to understanding a mindset vastly different from our own. 

 I harbored no doubts that I would be equally successful, marry a lovely girl, buy my own luxury car, and enjoy an amazing life by the blue Mediterranean. Yet, our attempts to assimilate were met with challenges at every turn, from clashes with armed police to the perils of deadly fires and the frustration of lost luggage.

However, I didn’t have much to bring to the table. My knowledge of Spanish culture, language, people, or running a business in a country controlled by a ruthless dictator was practically zilch. I was naïve enough to think this wouldn’t matter.

The main internal conflict lay in balancing our dreams and aspirations with the practical demands of business success and family dynamics. The dreams of a life far removed from Britain's rains were constantly weighed against the reality of our situation on the Costa del Sol, a place of little rain and much sun, yet filled with trials that tested our resolve at every turn.
