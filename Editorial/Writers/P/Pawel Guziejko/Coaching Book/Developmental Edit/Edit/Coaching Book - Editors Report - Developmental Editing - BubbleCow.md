## Understanding Your Feedback
Before I launch into more detailed feedback, I thought I’d run through how the edit has been structured.

You will have downloaded two files:

1.    The edited manuscript.
2.    The editor’s report.

The first is your original manuscript but now contains detailed editorial notes. The second is this file, which contains the thoughts of your editor. 

These are Word documents and contain both comments and tracked changes. If you don’t use Word, don’t worry; most modern word processing packages have the ability to ‘read’ Word manuscripts. 

If you are having problems opening your files, you can download this excellent word processing software for free - [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).

Before you dive into the edit I think it will help if you understand the ethos behind BubbleCow’s approach to providing feedback. 

We see the role of the edited manuscript to be that it offers specific, actionable feedback on a sentence/paragraph level problems. You should be able to apply the suggestions made on a line-by-line basis, without any real wider knowledge.

The role of the editor’s report is to provide a wider overview of the editing process. This means that if we have made changes to the manuscript that require a deeper rationale, these have been outlined and explained in the report. 

One way to consider the two documents is to see the report as the wider instructions and the manuscript as the practical application. You should be able to start each editing session by reading the editor’s report, before diving into the specific section of the manuscript. 
### Using Tracked Changes

If you are comfortable with comments and tracked changes, then you can jump ahead to the next section (‘Edited Manuscript’).

Tracked changes are like magic. Once they are turned on, they record everything that happens to your manuscript. You then have the power to go in and accept or reject the changes as you see fit. 

Comments are the little ‘speech’ bubbles that appear on the side of your manuscript. These allow your editor to add their thoughts and, in the process, allow you to ‘see’ the editing process. 

The video below will give you a more in-depth view of tracked changes and comments.

### Edited Manuscript
When you first open the edited manuscript, you may feel overwhelmed by the number of alterations. This is normal. 

The manuscript contains both my tracked changes and comments explaining the rationale behind these changes. In some cases, I’ve re-written passages or removed whole sections, but where I’ve done so I’ve sought to explain my thinking using comments. Where possible, I have also highlighted sections I feel work well.

The real power of tracked changes is that if you disagree with the comment or change, you can just ‘reject’ what I’ve said and carry on.

Whenever I’ve identified a persistent problem, I’ve stopped explaining any future changes within the comments and have instead just made the change. Where this is the case, I have written out an explanation for my rationale behind the changes in the editor’s report. You’ll need to read the comments I’ve left and review the changes, accepting or rejecting them as you see fit.
### Editor’s Report
The editor’s report should be read first, and is designed to ease you into the editing process by providing an overview and explanation. The aim is for you to use the feedback in both the manuscript and in this report as a means of formulating a plan to elevate your manuscript to the next level. 

I’ve split the report into several sections...
#### Typographical and Stylistic Details
You’ll find a summary of your book’s typographical and stylistic details, which lists things such as what form of English your book is written in, how you’re writing out times, whether you’re using the Oxford comma or not, etc. This section is useful as it collates information and serves as a future reference. It will also help you enforce a level of consistency on your book.
#### Strengths and Weaknesses
You’ll also find pointers that will give you an overview of what I think are the manuscript’s key strengths and weaknesses. If they’re turning up here, they are some of the manuscript’s biggest and most persistent problems, and will need addressing before any others. I’ll explain what the problem is, how it is manifested in your book, and why it is a problem. I’ll also suggest at least one possible solution.

Please note: I’ve approached your book from the point of view of a new reader. This means that I may make a comment early on but then later change my mind. This should give you a good indication of how a reader will be responding to the story and any confusions he/she may have. It should also help you to see my thinking process. Feedback has indicated that this can be very helpful for some writers.

Please remember that all the comments and changes come from a place of support, not criticism. I want to make the book the best it can be, as you do. I’m not here to cast judgement or project my own preferences. In fact, my role is to help nudge your writing style towards a place that will create the best possible reading experience. 

Our goal is to produce better books and better writers.

Finally, once you delve into the feedback, I’d suggest you read the notes and then take a day or two to absorb what I’ve suggested. If you disagree with any changes, that’s fine but please do take a little time to think them over before getting back to me. If after this cool-off period you have any questions or comments, please don’t hesitate to email me at gary@bubblecow.com.
## Notes on the Edited Manuscript

Below is a list of general comments about your manuscript. 

Please note, many of these changes have been made to help in the eBook conversion process. This process often involves the use of the original manuscript’s formatting to help ‘set’ the formatting of the eBook. However, this can be problematic. I have, therefore, made some changes to help negate any potential future issues. 

- I’ve run a basic spelling and grammar check. I’ve carefully made the alterations I felt were needed. This is not a proofread, but will add some level of consistency to your book.
- I have replaced double spaces with single spaces. This was to eliminate any unwanted ‘white space’, which is often removed during the eBook conversion process.
- I’ve set the line spacing to 1.5 lines. This helps with readability.
- I’ve added page breaks at the end of chapters. This will help with digital conversion.
- Ellipses have been formatted as … (dot dot dot), not . . . (dot space dot space dot space). 
## Stylistic and Typographical Summary
Below is a list of changes that have been made to help with readability and add consistency. 
### Language
British English
### Numeric Notation 
Spell out whole numbers up to (and including) one hundred (e.g., zero, one, ten, ninety-six, 104). Spell out numbers that begin a sentence unless it begins with a year (e.g., "Twelve drummers," "The ten lords a-leaping," "2011's quota for off-season holiday references has been filled."). 

Spell out ordinal numbers up to (and including) "hundredth" (e.g., second, sixty-first, 333rd, 1,024th). 

If you're juggling a bunch of numbers within the same paragraph or series of paragraphs, be flexible with the number style if doing so will improve clarity and comprehension. For example, use one number style for items in one category and another style for another category: "I read four books with more than 400 pages, sixty books with more than 100 pages, and a hundred articles with less than 4 pages."
### Speech Marks
Single for direct, double for reported
### Oxford Comma
No.
## Strengths and Weaknesses
In exploring the topic of football coaching for kids, this book stands out as a deeply insightful and valuable guide for coaches, parents, and educators. The writing is clear and the arguments are presented logically, making it easy for readers to follow along. One of the main strengths of the book is how it points out the flaws in the current football academy system, especially how too many young players are turned away too soon. You discusses this issue in a way that grabs the reader's attention and makes them want to keep reading.

The book's argument is convincing, encouraging readers to think differently about how young footballers are trained. It sheds light on the potential of kids who might be overlooked by traditional academies, suggesting coaches should embrace more inclusive and supportive coaching methods that see the value in every child.

By including real stories and examples, the book not only becomes more interesting but also shows that the alternative approaches it recommends can really work. This makes the book not just a good read but a practical guide offering real solutions for improving youth football coaching.

In summary, the book is a powerful call for change in youth football. It challenges old ways of thinking and encourages a more supportive approach to coaching that allows all kids to succeed. This book is an essential read for anyone involved in coaching young footballers, leaving readers motivated to make a positive difference.

This said, there were some issues that need addressing...

The book would benefit from a deeper exploration into how different countries approach the recruitment and training of young footballers. A comparative analysis could provide valuable insights into alternative methods and philosophies that could enhance the effectiveness of coaching strategies. Readers are likely looking for a broader perspective that includes successful models from abroad, which could offer fresh ideas on nurturing talent and developing skills in young athletes.

Another critical area for expansion is the discussion on the composition of staff within football academies. The book touches on the issue of academies being staffed predominantly by former football players and coaches rather than educators. Expanding on this point could shed light on the potential benefits of incorporating more educational professionals into the academy structure. This could include exploring how educators, with their understanding of child development and learning processes, could contribute to creating a more holistic and supportive environment for young athletes.

There's a need for a more in-depth discussion on how training models for young footballers are designed and implemented. The book would do well to delve into the process behind creating these models, including the research, philosophies, and methodologies that inform them. Understanding the foundation of these training programs could help coaches and academies refine their approaches to be more effective and aligned with the needs of young athletes. This section could also examine how training models adapt to changes in the sport, advances in sports science, and the evolving needs of children in different age groups.

Addressing these areas with more detail and depth would not only enrich the book's content but also provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved in coaching young footballers. Expanding on these topics would make the book an even more invaluable resource for those seeking to improve and innovate in the field of youth football coaching.
### International Approaches to Recruitment and Training
Expanding this section involves delving into the global landscape of youth football, highlighting the diversity of approaches across different countries and cultures. By examining the recruitment and training methodologies in countries renowned for their successful youth development programs, the book could offer a richer, more nuanced understanding of what makes these systems effective.

Countries like the Netherlands, Germany, and Spain, for instance, have been lauded for their comprehensive youth development schemes that not only focus on technical skills but also on the holistic development of young athletes. These countries integrate education, psychological development, and social skills into their training programs, reflecting a broader understanding of what it takes to nurture not just a footballer but a well-rounded individual.

In contrast, nations like Brazil and Argentina have produced some of the world's most technically gifted players through street football and informal training environments. This contrast raises intriguing questions about the balance between formal training and creative freedom in developing young talent.

A comparative analysis could explore:
- The structure of youth academies and how they integrate with professional clubs.
- The role of government and football associations in supporting youth development.
- The emphasis on education and life skills alongside football training.
- The cultural attitudes towards youth football and how these influence training methods.

Moreover, examining the age at which players turn professional in different countries could reveal interesting trends about the pathways to a professional career. For instance, comparing the average age of players entering the professional arena in countries with structured youth academies versus those with less formal pathways could offer insights into the effectiveness of different development models. It could also shed light on the pressures young athletes face and the potential for burnout or injury.

Additionally, incorporating statistical data and success stories can substantiate the discussion, making a compelling case for adopting certain practices over others. For example, looking at the figures of youth players who transition to professional levels in countries with high rates of professionalization could help identify key factors contributing to their success.

By expanding on these aspects, the book would not only provide a comprehensive overview of global youth football development but also inspire coaches, parents, and administrators to adopt innovative approaches tailored to their unique contexts. This could ultimately lead to a more vibrant, inclusive, and effective youth football ecosystem worldwide.

### Role of Educators in Academies
To further develop the discussion on the staffing composition within football academies, it's essential to delve into the multi-dimensional role that educators can play in this setting. The current trend of staffing academies with former players and coaches focuses heavily on the technical and tactical aspects of football, often overlooking the broader developmental needs of young athletes. By integrating educators—who bring expertise in child development, psychology, and pedagogy—into the academy system, a more holistic approach to player development can be achieved.

Educators, with their specialized knowledge in learning styles and developmental stages, can offer invaluable insights into the cognitive and emotional growth of young athletes. This expertise can enhance the academy's ability to tailor training programs to the individual needs of players, recognizing that each child's developmental path is unique. For example, educators can help design curricula that not only advance football skills but also foster critical thinking, teamwork, resilience, and leadership.

Moreover, educators can implement evidence-based practices in teaching and learning to enhance the educational component of academies. This could involve the use of innovative teaching methods that make learning more engaging and effective, both on and off the pitch. By doing so, academies can ensure that young athletes receive a well-rounded education that prepares them for a variety of futures, recognizing that not all will pursue professional football careers.

The benefits of incorporating educators into football academies extend beyond individual player development. Educators can also contribute to creating a positive, supportive environment that prioritizes the well-being of young athletes. This involves recognizing and addressing the psychological pressures associated with elite sports training, providing guidance on managing stress, and fostering a culture of mental health awareness.

Furthermore, educators can play a crucial role in bridging the gap between the academy and the educational system, ensuring that young athletes do not have to choose between pursuing their football aspirations and their academic studies. By facilitating flexible scheduling, offering tutoring services, and coordinating with schools, educators can help young athletes maintain a balance between their sporting and academic commitments.
### Development of Training Models
To expand on the discussion of training models for young footballers, it is crucial to unpack the multifaceted process behind their development and execution. This exploration should start with the foundational research that informs training philosophies, emphasizing evidence-based practices that ensure the safety, well-being, and optimal development of young athletes. By scrutinizing the scientific literature on sports science, child psychology, and education theory, academies can create training models that are not only technically proficient but also supportive of the holistic development of young players.

Methodologies in training models should reflect the latest in sports science, incorporating practices that promote physical health, technical skill, tactical understanding, and psychological resilience. This includes varied training routines that stimulate different aspects of a player's game, rest and recovery periods to prevent burnout and injury, and mental health resources to support players' well-being. Moreover, understanding the specific needs of different age groups is critical; what works for teenagers nearing professional readiness might not be suitable for younger children who are just starting. Training models should therefore be adaptable, evolving in complexity and intensity as players grow and develop.

The design and implementation of these training models must consider the evolving needs of children. This includes not only their physical and technical development but also their educational needs, social skills, and emotional intelligence. Training models should be flexible enough to accommodate the complex lives of young athletes, recognizing that they are not just footballers but also students, friends, and family members.
### Outliers
In Malcom Gladwell's boolk"Outliers: The Story of Success"​​, he talks about the way in which ice hockey recruitment is carried out. 

He discusses the recruitment of ice hockey players in Canada to illustrate how success can be significantly influenced by seemingly arbitrary factors, such as a player's birth month. 

Birth Month Advantage: Gladwell points out that a disproportionate number of professional ice hockey players in Canada are born in the first few months of the year. This is due to the cutoff dates for age-class hockey, which favor older children within the same age group.

Cumulative Advantage: The slightly older children, who are bigger, stronger, and more mature, often receive more attention, better coaching, and more opportunities to practice. This advantage starts small but grows over time, a phenomenon Gladwell describes as the "Matthew Effect."

Systemic Bias: The recruitment and development system, unintentionally, favors those born earlier in the year, perpetuating a cycle where these individuals are more likely to succeed.

Implications Beyond Sports: Gladwell uses this example to argue that talent and hard work alone do not guarantee success. Instead, external factors, such as cultural, environmental, and systemic biases, play a significant role in determining who succeeds.
### Conclusion
The conclusive chapter of your book brings together the core themes discussed throughout, offering a compelling synthesis of your insights into the challenges and opportunities within youth football coaching. 

However, the chapter could gain additional depth and value by incorporating a section that candidly addresses the potential limitations of the arguments made in the book. Acknowledging areas that might benefit from further debate, thought, and research could enhance the book’s impact. Such a reflective stance would not only underscore your commitment to an honest and nuanced discussion but also encourage a broader dialogue within the coaching community. Highlighting these aspects could invite readers—whether they are coaches, parents, or educators—to contribute their perspectives, experiences, and findings to the ongoing conversation about youth football coaching.

Moreover, pinpointing specific aspects of the youth coaching paradigm that warrant deeper examination or areas where prevailing assumptions may be challenged would demonstrate an openness to evolving ideas. This approach could pave the way for future innovations in coaching practices and philosophies. For instance, further exploration into the psychological impact of competitive pressure on young athletes or the long-term effects of early specialization could provide fertile ground for research and discussion.
## Chapter Feedback
This section contains specific feedback about your chapters. This feedback is in addition to the Specific Feedback.  
### Chapter 1
- At the start of this chapter you talk about 'professional' football. I think you need to define this term. Does getting paid £20 to play on a Saturday for a country team count as professional? What about national league teams that don't carry 'professional' status but still pay players? If you are only talking about the top level, perhaps 100 teams in total, than there only probably a couple of thousand professional players in the country. Also, do you only mean pro-footballers in England? What about those moving outside the English FA, are they counted in the figures? 
- You talk about funding by the FA, how does this compare to other countries? For example, Holland, Germany and Spain. 
- You mention specialization. I would have liked to understand how this compares to other countries. My understanding is that places like the Netherlands, allow younger players to play in a number of positions.  
- One thing that did occur to me with the current system is that by using cheap labour to recruit large numbers of children, it does then allow more qualified people to assess this group. This is relatively cost effective for the club.
- I feel that I can add a little flesh to the idea of local children's football. I have run several kids teams and there were always a couple of factors that stopped professional clubs interacting more fully with the teams. The first was the lack of coaching skills. Most of these teams are run by dads with zero coaching skills. Local professional teams are reluctant to let talented kids into this environment. The second is lack of facilities. Most local clubs break even at best. They spend so much money on winter training that often even buys kits is hard. It means that resources are limited, another factor making any kind of meaningful training hard. I full within Everton's community environment and even with their amazing work there is a huge gap between local and aceadmy football. 
- In 1.4, you talk about profiling. I think I wanted to see a bit more about the fact that the real problem was that no one knows the profile of a young player. In fact, it is probably impossible to tell at a young age. This means the system is all about casting a wide net and this means lots of rejections. 
### Chapter 2
- 2.1 - I wanted to know more about how the game and training model was developed. Are they the same for each academy? Are the based on some kind of group thinking? Is there a central view on the best way to do things?
- 2.2 - I wondered if the game's obsession with bringing ex-pros in to manage and coach means that the focus naturally falls to the game nit the education. After all, if you have an ex-pro in a senior training role, the is going to focus on what he knows best, football. It always struck me as strange that an ex-pro would be preferred to someone that had not played professionally but had spent years learning how to coach. 

### Chapter 3
- 3.1 - You are talking about motor skills. It is worth talking about the attempts to introduce Futsol to the UK as a sport that could be played on the streets and informally? I know there have been an increase in futfol leagues in recent years. 
- I really love the idea that emotional aspects have been ignored. This is such a vital part of the game. I remember there was some research done on taking penalties and how under pressure it stopped being muscle memory and become emotional. 
- 3.2 - One thing I did wonder was about training when passing. In many of the new pressing systems, the aim is to put the player under pressure in that period where they receive the ball and are bringing in under control. I wonder if part of the success of the high press is that players are simple not used to receiving the ball under pressure since this was not a training technique a few years ago when the current crop of pros were in the academies.  
- 3.3 - You have mentioned a few times about winning and creating teams to win. Are the parent's wishes ever taken into account I suspect parents would not be happy to see their son placed into a team that they deemed a 'weak'. Is this ever a consideration?
- 3.4 - One thing I wanted you to stress with kids playing 11-aside football was just how crazy it was in comparison to size. The pitches are massive. It is just not a fair. Plus, the goalkeepers can't reach the tops of the goal, its just silly. 

### Chapter 4
- 4.1 - You talk about 'London' cages in this section and use quotes to reinforce the idea that it helped players. However, how how the percentage of player in London compare to the rest of the country. Is there a higher percentage of players who turn pro from areas with cages? Or, if this just a case of the fact that all inner city players ONLY had cages as a place to play. Would you find that players from more affluent ages talk about having access to full size pitches from a young age? I know my kids never had access to cages but they did have a small park with goals a few minutes from their house.   
- I wonder if the Bazball (https://inews.co.uk/sport/cricket/bazball-bigger-better-2024-ugly-india-2828384) approach in cricket (and not English Rugby) is something worth talking about. 
- 4.2 - How do you feel about the non-competitive leagues for kid's amateur football? I know that many local amateur leagues don't become competitive until the older age groups. They will also not record scores over a certain goal difference, say 9 - 0. 
- 4.3 - One thing that did strike me here was in regard to development. You mention that slower developing players physically, developed other skills to cope and that means when they develop physically they are superior players. Does this not mean that if you were to put kids of similar physical capability together, they would not then go on to develop the beneficial skills?
### Chapter 5
- I found this a good chapter. I think the only thing I wanted to add was I needed more information about how the training models were built. For example, I thought the focus on passing was on the understanding that teams who pass the ball more tend to score more goals (tikka takka etc.) and therefore, players should be taught this.
