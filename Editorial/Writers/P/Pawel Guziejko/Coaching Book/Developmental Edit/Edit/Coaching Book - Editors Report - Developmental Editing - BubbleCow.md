## Understanding Your Feedback

Before I launch into more detailed feedback, I thought I’d run through how the edit has been structured.

You will have downloaded two files:

1.    The edited manuscript.
2.    The editor’s report.

The first is your original manuscript but now contains detailed editorial notes. The second is this file, which contains the thoughts of your editor. 

These are Word documents and contain both comments and tracked changes. If you don’t use Word, don’t worry; most modern word processing packages have the ability to ‘read’ Word manuscripts. 

If you are having problems opening your files, you can download this excellent word processing software for free - [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).

Before you dive into the edit I think it will help if you understand the ethos behind BubbleCow’s approach to providing feedback. 

We see the role of the edited manuscript to be that it offers specific, actionable feedback on a sentence/paragraph level problems. You should be able to apply the suggestions made on a line-by-line basis, without any real wider knowledge.

The role of the editor’s report is to provide a wider overview of the editing process. This means that if we have made changes to the manuscript that require a deeper rationale, these have been outlined and explained in the report. 

One way to consider the two documents is to see the report as the wider instructions and the manuscript as the practical application. You should be able to start each editing session by reading the editor’s report, before diving into the specific section of the manuscript. 
### Using Tracked Changes

If you are comfortable with comments and tracked changes, then you can jump ahead to the next section (‘Edited Manuscript’).

Tracked changes are like magic. Once they are turned on, they record everything that happens to your manuscript. You then have the power to go in and accept or reject the changes as you see fit. 

Comments are the little ‘speech’ bubbles that appear on the side of your manuscript. These allow your editor to add their thoughts and, in the process, allow you to ‘see’ the editing process. 

The video below will give you a more in-depth view of tracked changes and comments.

### Edited Manuscript
When you first open the edited manuscript, you may feel overwhelmed by the number of alterations. This is normal. 

The manuscript contains both my tracked changes and comments explaining the rationale behind these changes. In some cases, I’ve re-written passages or removed whole sections, but where I’ve done so I’ve sought to explain my thinking using comments. Where possible, I have also highlighted sections I feel work well.

The real power of tracked changes is that if you disagree with the comment or change, you can just ‘reject’ what I’ve said and carry on.

Whenever I’ve identified a persistent problem, I’ve stopped explaining any future changes within the comments and have instead just made the change. Where this is the case, I have written out an explanation for my rationale behind the changes in the editor’s report. You’ll need to read the comments I’ve left and review the changes, accepting or rejecting them as you see fit.

### Editor’s Report
The editor’s report should be read first, and is designed to ease you into the editing process by providing an overview and explanation. The aim is for you to use the feedback in both the manuscript and in this report as a means of formulating a plan to elevate your manuscript to the next level. 

I’ve split the report into several sections...
#### Typographical and Stylistic Details
You’ll find a summary of your book’s typographical and stylistic details, which lists things such as what form of English your book is written in, how you’re writing out times, whether you’re using the Oxford comma or not, etc. This section is useful as it collates information and serves as a future reference. It will also help you enforce a level of consistency on your book.

#### Strengths and Weaknesses
You’ll also find pointers that will give you an overview of what I think are the manuscript’s key strengths and weaknesses. If they’re turning up here, they are some of the manuscript’s biggest and most persistent problems, and will need addressing before any others. I’ll explain what the problem is, how it is manifested in your book, and why it is a problem. I’ll also suggest at least one possible solution.

Please note: I’ve approached your book from the point of view of a new reader. This means that I may make a comment early on but then later change my mind. This should give you a good indication of how a reader will be responding to the story and any confusions he/she may have. It should also help you to see my thinking process. Feedback has indicated that this can be very helpful for some writers.

Please remember that all the comments and changes come from a place of support, not criticism. I want to make the book the best it can be, as you do. I’m not here to cast judgement or project my own preferences. In fact, my role is to help nudge your writing style towards a place that will create the best possible reading experience. 

Our goal is to produce better books and better writers.

Finally, once you delve into the feedback, I’d suggest you read the notes and then take a day or two to absorb what I’ve suggested. If you disagree with any changes, that’s fine but please do take a little time to think them over before getting back to me. If after this cool-off period you have any questions or comments, please don’t hesitate to email me at gary@bubblecow.com.
## Notes on the Edited Manuscript

Below is a list of general comments about your manuscript. 

Please note, many of these changes have been made to help in the eBook conversion process. This process often involves the use of the original manuscript’s formatting to help ‘set’ the formatting of the eBook. However, this can be problematic. I have, therefore, made some changes to help negate any potential future issues. 

- I’ve run a basic spelling and grammar check. I’ve carefully made the alterations I felt were needed. This is not a proofread, but will add some level of consistency to your book.
- I have replaced double spaces with single spaces. This was to eliminate any unwanted ‘white space’, which is often removed during the eBook conversion process.
- I’ve set the line spacing to 1.5 lines. This helps with readability.
- I’ve added page breaks at the end of chapters. This will help with digital conversion.
- Ellipses have been formatted as … (dot dot dot), not . . . (dot space dot space dot space). 
## Stylistic and Typographical Summary

Below is a list of changes that have been made to help with readability and add consistency. 
### Language

> [!warning]
> American English
> British English
### Numeric Notation 
Spell out whole numbers up to (and including) one hundred (e.g., zero, one, ten, ninety-six, 104). Spell out numbers that begin a sentence unless it begins with a year (e.g., "Twelve drummers," "The ten lords a-leaping," "2011's quota for off-season holiday references has been filled."). 

Spell out ordinal numbers up to (and including) "hundredth" (e.g., second, sixty-first, 333rd, 1,024th). 

If you're juggling a bunch of numbers within the same paragraph or series of paragraphs, be flexible with the number style if doing so will improve clarity and comprehension. For example, use one number style for items in one category and another style for another category: "I read four books with more than 400 pages, sixty books with more than 100 pages, and a hundred articles with less than 4 pages."

### Speech Marks
> [!warning]
> Double for direct, single for reported. 
> Single for direct, double for reported
### Oxford Comma
> [!warning]
> Yes.
> No.

is one problem that acedmeies are led by footballmen not educators, they are seen to find the next tralnet not educate, if there a belife in 'natura talent' and not nuture. If they beleive footballers are found no made, this changes the approach.

## Chapter Feedback
This section contains specific feedback about your chapters. This feedback is in addition to the Specific Feedback.  
### Chapter 1
- At the start of this chapter you talk about 'professional' football. I think you need to define this term. Does getting paid £20 to play on a Saturday for a country team count as professional? What about national league teams that don't carry 'professional' status but still pay players? If you are only talking about the top level, perhaps 100 teams in total, than there only probably a couple of thousand professional players in the country. Also, do you only mean pro-footballers in England? What about those moving outside the English FA, are they counted in the figures? 
- You talk about funding by the FA, how does this compare to other countries? For example, Holland, Germany and Spain. 
- You mention specialization. I would have liked to understand how this compares to other countries. My understanding is that places like the Netherlands, allow younger players to play in a number of positions.  
- One thing that did occur to me with the current system is that by using cheap labour to recruit large numbers of children, it does then allow more qualified people to assess this group. This is relatively cost effective for the club.
- I feel that I can add a little flesh to the idea of local children's football. I have run several kids teams and there were always a couple of factors that stopped professional clubs interacting more fully with the teams. The first was the lack of coaching skills. Most of these teams are run by dads with zero coaching skills. Local professional teams are reluctant to let talented kids into this environment. The second is lack of facilities. Most local clubs break even at best. They spend so much money on winter training that often even buys kits is hard. It means that resources are limited, another factor making any kind of meaningful training hard. I full within Everton's community environment and even with their amazing work there is a huge gap between local and aceadmy football. 
- In 1.4, you talk about profiling. I think I wanted to see a bit more about the fact that the real problem was that no one knows the profile of a young player. In fact, it is probably impossible to tell at a young age. This means the system is all about casting a wide net and this means lots of rejections. 
### Chapter 2
- 2.1 - I wanted to know more about how the game and training model was developed. Are they the same for each academy? Are the based on some kind of group thinking? Is there a central view on the best way to do things?
- 2.2 - I wondered if the game's obsession with bringing ex-pros in to manage and coach means that the focus naturally falls to the game nit the education. After all, if you have an ex-pro in a senior training role, the is going to focus on what he knows best, football. It always struck me as strange that an ex-pro would be preferred to someone that had not played professionally but had spent years learning how to coach. 

### Chapter 3
- 3.1 - You are talking about motor skills. It is worth talking about the attempts to introduce Futsol to the UK as a sport that could be played on the streets and informally? I know there have been an increase in futfol leagues in recent years. 
- I really love the idea that emotional aspects have been ignored. This is such a vital part of the game. I remember there was some research done on taking penalties and how under pressure it stopped being muscle memory and become emotional. 
- 3.2 - One thing I did wonder was about training when passing. In many of the new pressing systems, the aim is to put the player under pressure in that period where they receive the ball and are bringing in under control. I wonder if part of the success of the high press is that players are simple not used to receiving the ball under pressure since this was not a training technique a few years ago when the current crop of pros were in the academies.  
- 3.3 - You have mentioned a few times about winning and creating teams to win. Are the parent's wishes ever taken into account I suspect parents would not be happy to see their son placed into a team that they deemed a 'weak'. Is this ever a consideration?
- 3.4 - One thing I wanted you to stress with kids playing 11-aside football was just how crazy it was in comparison to size. The pitches are massive. It is just not a fair. Plus, the goalkeepers can't reach the tops of the goal, its just silly. 

### Chapter 4
- 4.1 - You talk about 'London' cages in this section and use quotes to reinforce the idea that it helped players. However, how how the percentage of player in London compare to the rest of the country. Is there a higher percentage of players who turn pro from areas with cages? Or, if this just a case of the fact that all inner city players ONLY had cages as a place to play. Would you find that players from more affluent ages talk about having access to full size pitches from a young age? I know my kids never had access to cages but they did have a small park with goals a few minutes from their house.   
- I wonder if the Bazball (https://inews.co.uk/sport/cricket/bazball-bigger-better-2024-ugly-india-2828384) approach in cricket (and not English Rugby) is something worth talking about. 
- 4.2 - How do you feel about the non-competitive leagues for kid's amateur football? I know that many local amateur leagues don't become competitive until the older age groups. They will also not record scores over a certain goal difference, say 9 - 0. 
- 4.3 - One thing that did strike me here was in regard to development. You mention that slower developing players physically, developed other skills to cope and that means when they develop physically they are superior players. Does this not mean that if you were to put kids of similar physical capability together, they would not then go on to develop the beneficial skills?
### Chapter 5
- I found this a good chapter. I think the only thing I wanted to add was I needed more information about how the training models were built. For example, I thought the focus on passing was on the understanding that teams who pass the ball more tend to score more goals (tikka takka etc.) and therefore, players should be taught this.
