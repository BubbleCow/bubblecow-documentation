This is much darker and gritty but better.

## Description
Your description is really good. However, it would benefit from a little more development. I want you to think much more about layering in more detail of the mundane. This will help to ground the reader and build out your world. 

For example, in Chapter 16 Romack is by a waste pipe. Think more about what this would be like for the character. The noise would be loud from the water. The smell would be terrible. His face would be splashed by the stinking water. The rocks would be slippy with slime. These little details really help to slow the pace, ground the reader and drill home hte world building. 
## POV Chapter
## Chapter 16
Romack contemplates life. Polliwog. Schematic. Powlers. Man with sack. In the water. 
- I love the dark and dank feeling you are creating in this chapter, but in the your world as a whole. There is a feeling of a broken world with these characters baring holding on as events unfold. 
- I also liked that we are having more insight in Romack, his race and what that feels like in the world as a whole. 
- You need to make sure that you are adding descriptions of the prowlers, are they human? 
## Chapter 17
Kayah in and out of consciousness. 
Voices in the confusion. 
Executioner's voice and others. 
Wakes. Cutthroats. 
Wakes. Talks to executioner. Contemplates escape. 
- I like the slow, deliberate, pace of this chapter. You can feel Kayah's helplessness as the story progresses. 
- When she wakes and talks to the executioner, I wanted you to layer in a description of the character. You don't need much but you need something. It will help the reader to picture the scene and ground themselves after all the sleep sections 
- You seem to be using executioner and Cindered Man interchangeably, this is potentially confusing. You are better to pick one and stick to it, I suggest the Cindered Man. 
- I think that the prowler POV chapter works but it could be a little confusing. I have made a note on this. 
## Chapter 18
Vagrants arguing. Wearkin. On pipes and ledges. Stranger. Dravius. 
Progressing in sewer. Follows woman. 
- You need to start this chapter with better location and character description so the readers can ground themselves in the chapter.  
- I liked this chapter, the story feels as though it is moving forward. The sewers are a good backdrop and leave the reader with a feeling of isolation and danger for Baran. 
## Chapter 19
Romak in sewers. Dravius. Creatures. 
- I liked this chapter, it seems conhesive with the other chapters.
