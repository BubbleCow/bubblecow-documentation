## Description
Your description is really good. However, it would benefit from a little more development. I want you to think much more about layering in more detail of the mundane. This will help to ground the reader and build out your world. 

For example, in Chapter 16 Romack is by a waste pipe. Think more about what this would be like for the character. The noise would be loud from the water. The smell would be terrible. His face would be splashed by the stinking water. The rocks would be slippy with slime. These little details really help to slow the pace, ground the reader and drill home hte world building. 

## Chapter 16
Romack contemplates life. Polliwog. Schematic. 
- I love the dark and dank feeling you are creating in this chapter, but in the your world as a whole. There is a feeling of a broken world with these characters baring holding on as events unfold. 
- I also liked that we are having more insight in Romack, his race and what that feels like in the world as a whole.
