### Scene 1: Execution Day - January 1649

**EXT. WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY**

A bitter January chill grips the air. We find ourselves outside an Elizabethan house adjacent to Whitehall Palace. A sprawling square teems with onlookers, their breaths forming misty clouds. ROUGHLY CLAD TROOPS work diligently to hold back the burgeoning crowd. At the square's center, a sinister platform looms—complete with an executioner, his gleaming axe, and the ominous block.

KING CHARLES I emerges from the house, an image of defiance. He's clad in a hat, a cloak, and notably, two shirts to ward off the cold—a detail that speaks volumes. Soldiers swiftly encircle him, yet he maintains a brisk pace towards Whitehall, momentarily catching his escorts off guard with his resolve.

As he slows upon reaching the square, his eyes lock onto a MAN IN CAVALIER REGALIA, mounted on horseback among the sea of faces. A silent exchange passes between them—a nod, heavy with unspoken understanding.

Without breaking stride, KING CHARLES I continues on, entering the palace with the weight of his fate on his shoulders, leaving a palpable tension hanging over the square.
### Scene 2: A Last Glimpse

**EXT. WHITEHALL SQUARE - DAY**

The square is beginning to empty, the grim spectacle over. Near the entrance, the MAN IN CAVALIER REGALIA, now identified as JIMMY, is not alone. Beside him, an ELDERLY WOMAN, dignified and strong despite her age, sits astride her horse. Both of their faces are etched with grief and the weight of what they've just witnessed.

Tears carve silent paths down Jimmy's cheeks, the aftermath of a sorrow too deep for words. He turns to the woman, his voice barely above a whisper.

JIMMY  
Did you see that?

The woman nods, her own eyes glistening with unshed tears, yet her voice is steady, imbued with a somber resilience.

WOMAN  
I did. You will probably be the last friendly face he sees in this lifetime. Treasure that moment, Jimmy.

A resolve hardens in Jimmy's eyes, the tears drying in the cold air as determination takes their place. He clenches his fists, the weight of his resolve palpable.

JIMMY  
I shall. And I shall fight on until the cause is won!

The conviction in his voice rings out, a clarion call of defiance and loyalty in the face of despair. The elderly woman nods, a silent pact sealed between them. They turn their horses away from the square, their silhouettes stark against the setting sun, ready to continue the fight that the day's events have only deepened.

### Scene 3: On the Scaffold

**EXT. EXECUTION SITE - WHITEHALL - DAY**

The atmosphere is thick with anticipation and dread. SOLDIERS work with grim determination, pushing the gathered crowds back, ensuring a clear space around the execution platform. The air is cold, the mood somber.

Suddenly, the balcony doors swing open, and KING CHARLES I, accompanied by a BISHOP, steps onto the scaffold. The crowd, a mix of supporters, detractors, and the simply curious, watches in rapt silence.

KING CHARLES I, with a regal calmness that belies his situation, adjusts his hat and takes a moment to survey the scene before him. There's a profound solemnity in his gaze, a king facing his subjects for the last time.

KING CHARLES I  
(strong and clear)  
My people, understand that I seek your freedom. If I were willing to give way to rule by the sword, I would not be here. I am a martyr for my people. I go from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown.

His words echo across the silent square, each syllable laden with dignity and a haunting foreboding. This is not just the end of a king, but the closing of a chapter in the nation's history.

With solemn grace, CHARLES removes his hat and cloak, donning a simpler cap. He then kneels over the block, his body language one of acceptance and prayer. The bishop stands by, a silent sentinel in this moment of reverence.

The crowd, previously a cacophony of whispers and shuffling, falls into an even deeper silence, a collective breath held in anticipation and respect. The air seems to freeze, time itself pausing to witness this moment of profound sacrifice.

### Scene 4: The Execution

**EXT. EXECUTION SITE - WHITEHALL - DAY**

The camera sweeps over the silent, somber crowd, capturing a tableau of anticipation and dread. Faces are drawn, eyes wide, a collective entity holding its breath, united in this moment of history.

Then, in a singular, heart-stopping moment, the SOUND OF AN AXE CRASHING into the block echoes through the square, a grim punctuation that signifies the end of an era. The crowd, a moment ago wrapped in silence, lets out a terrible, communal groan—a sound that seems to carry the weight of the nation's sorrow, conflict, and tumult.

The camera lingers on the crowd's reaction, faces contorted in grief, shock, and for some, a grim resolution. In the immediate aftermath, there is a palpable shift, a sense of a pivotal moment passed, leaving an indelible mark on the collective psyche of a nation.

CUT TO:

The executioner, a figure now synonymous with the act just committed, stands silent, the axe by his side. The block, bearing the stark evidence of the act, remains in the center of the scaffold—a focal point of finality.

As the camera pulls back, the scaffold against the backdrop of Whitehall, the crowd, and the grey sky above, encapsulates the solemnity of the moment, the end of King Charles I's reign, and the profound uncertainty about what the future holds for England.

### Scene 5: Colchester as the Siege Ends

**EXT. COLCHESTER STREETS - DAY**

The narrow, winding streets of 17th Century Colchester are alive with the chaos and clamor of a city under siege. Crowds of anxious citizens and weary soldiers fill the thoroughfares, moving amidst the dirt and debris that mark the hardships of war.

Through this turbulent sea of people moves a solitary FEMALE FIGURE, her lower face obscured by scarves, blending yet distinct in her determination. Her pace is purposeful, yet cautious, as she navigates the crowded, uneven streets towards the town gate.

Suddenly, she's jostled by the crowd, an inadvertent shove sending her stumbling. As she falls, her skirts ride up, fleetingly revealing cavalry boots beneath—a stark contrast to her otherwise civilian guise. It's a moment of vulnerability, unnoticed by the throng around her.

Regaining her composure, she rises quickly, pressing her back against a wall. Her eyes dart around, alert, ready to defend herself if challenged. The moment passes without confrontation, and she resumes her journey, moving with renewed urgency.

As she approaches the gate, the throng thickens, the air tense with the anticipation of escape or capture. A SOLDIER, more interested in personal gratification than duty, reaches out to grope her as she passes. With a mixture of defiance and the need to remain undetected, she doesn't react aggressively but instead quickens her pace, slipping through the gate and out of his reach.

Once through the gate, the camera follows her as she distances herself from the soldier, the city, and the immediate danger. Her stride is quick and determined, the outskirts of Colchester offering a temporary respite as she merges with others seeking safety beyond the city's confines.

### Scene 6: Parliamentarian Camps

**EXT. PARLIAMENTARIAN CAMPS - DAY**

Just outside the gates of Colchester, the expansive Parliamentarian encampments sprawl across the landscape, a sea of tents and bustling activity. Smoke from numerous campfires curls into the sky, blurring the line between land and air, while the sounds of soldiers and horses fill the air with a constant, restless din.

The FEMALE FIGURE, having just passed through the city gate, now finds herself navigating a new maze: the crowded, chaotic encampments of the Parliamentarian troops. Her movements are cautious, deliberate, as she attempts to blend in while making her way through.

Suddenly, her path is blocked by a TROOPER, his intentions clear from his leering gaze. Despite her attempts to sidestep him and continue on her way, he reaches out, grabbing her arm, and drags her to the side.

SOLDIER  
(sneering)  
And where might you be going? You’ll have plenty of business when we enter tomorrow.

WOMAN  
(trying to maintain composure)  
I’m going to visit my sister. I’ll be back in a day or two.

SOLDIER  
(leering closer)  
Your sister doesn’t have what I have.

The situation escalates until a DARK FIGURE on a white horse approaches, the authority and urgency in his approach unmistakable.

HORSEMAN  
(sharp, commanding)  
What the Hell do you think you are doing, trooper?

The soldier snaps to attention, recognizing the authority in the horseman's voice. The camera reveals the horseman to be LORD FAIRFAX, a figure of command and respect among the troops.

FAIRFAX  
(calmly authoritative)  
You will release this woman now.

With a reluctant scowl, the trooper lets go of the woman, stepping back. Lord Fairfax then turns to the woman, his expression softening as he addresses her.

FAIRFAX  
(genuinely apologetic)  
I apologize for his behavior. You are free to go.

After ensuring the woman is unharmed and on her way, Fairfax turns his attention back to the trooper, his demeanor shifting from protector to disciplinarian. The trooper knows he's in for a reprimand as Fairfax begins to deal with him, a clear demonstration of leadership and integrity in the midst of war's chaos.

### Scene 7: Escape Through the Woodland

**EXT. WOODLAND - DAY**

The camera follows the WOMAN as she moves with a palpable sense of urgency, finally leaving the stifling atmosphere of the military encampments behind. The landscape shifts from the trampled earth of the camp to the dappled sunlight of the woodland. Here, the air is fresher, filled with the sounds of nature—a stark contrast to the tension and turmoil she's just escaped.

As she ventures deeper into the woods, the sounds of the camp fade away, replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant calls of birds. She slows, allowing herself a moment of relief, her shoulders visibly relaxing for the first time.

With a cautious glance around to ensure she's alone, she steps off the main road, finding solace in the seclusion of the trees. It's here, shielded from prying eyes by the woodland's embrace, that she begins to transform.

Piece by piece, the woman's attire is shed, revealing the truth hidden beneath—a truth not just of identity, but of defiance and resilience. JAMES stands where the woman once was, his disguise discarded along with the vulnerability it implied.

JAMES  
(under his breath, with resolve)  
Freedom lies not in the open road, but in the paths we dare to carve from the wilderness.

With a final glance back towards the way he came, James turns and delves deeper into the woodland, his stride confident, his direction sure. He is a man on a mission, driven by a purpose that the confines of society—or its expectations—cannot contain.

CUT TO:

James, now far removed from the dangers of the camp and the road, moves with the ease of one familiar with the hidden trails and secret ways of the land. The woodland is not just an escape; it's a route to somewhere—or to someone—significant, a part of a larger plan set into motion.

### Scene 8: Reunion with Moll

**EXT. WOODLAND CLEARING - DAY**

A secluded clearing in the woodland serves as the backdrop for this scene, where a rickety shed stands as a testament to the secrecy and urgency of these times. The door is ajar, revealing a dimly lit interior.

JAMES, having shed his female disguise but still donning the remnants of his escape attire, arrives at the clearing. He approaches the shed with a familiarity borne of many such meetings in the past.

Inside, MOLL, an elderly woman with a steely gaze and an unyielding posture, is seated at a makeshift table littered with maps and documents. She looks up as James enters, her surprise evident at his appearance.

ELDERLY WOMAN (MOLL)  
(shocked)  
James, what in the name of God are you wearing?

JAMES  
(with a wry smile)  
It was the only way I could escape. Soldiers kept trying to hire me along the way – I ended up being released by Lord Fairfax.

MOLL  
(chuckling despite herself)  
Well, you’ll have to find some proper clothes. I have a reputation to uphold.

JAMES  
(jokingly)  
I’ll steal some along the way.

MOLL  
(sarcastically)  
Your reputation wouldn't survive being recognized like that either. Where did you get those clothes, from, a brothel?

JAMES  
(slightly embarrassed)  
Well, yes.

MOLL  
(taking charge)  
No wonder you were accosted! Let's get moving; we don't want to be near that ragtag army.

As MOLL stands, she gathers a few essential items from the table, stuffing them into a bag with efficiency and care. JAMES, still amused at their banter, follows suit, preparing for the journey ahead. Together, they step out of the shed, ready to face whatever challenges lie on the road before them.

Their interaction, a blend of humor, concern, and mutual respect, highlights the depth of their relationship. As they disappear into the woodland, their silhouettes fading into the foliage, the scene underscores the gravity of their situation and the resilience of those committed to their cause.

### Scene 9: A Muddy Road on the Side of a Hill

**EXT. MUDDY ROAD ON A HILLSIDE - DAY**

The relentless downpour transforms the landscape into a sodden tableau. Amidst this deluge, a SMALL TROOP OF FIVE BEDRAGGLED SOLDIERS battles with a wagon mired in the mud. Their efforts are desperate, their movements frenetic against the backdrop of the pouring rain, which reduces visibility to nearly nothing.

The soldiers, their uniforms soaked through and clinging to their bodies, work in unison but with growing frustration. They place planks under the wagon's wheels, a makeshift attempt to gain traction in the relentless muck.

SOLDIER 1  
(shouting over the rain)  
On three! One... two... three!

They heave against the wagon with a unified grunt, their faces set in grim determination. The wagon budges slightly, an inch of progress bought with an immense effort.

SOLDIER 2  
(voice strained)  
Again! Push!

The rain intensifies, as if nature itself challenges their resolve. The planks slip, betraying their efforts, but the soldiers refuse to yield. With each attempt, they reclaim a bit more ground, a testament to their determination not to be defeated by mud and weather.

SOLDIER 3  
(gasping for breath)  
We're not letting this damn rain stop us!

Their camaraderie and shared struggle against the elements highlight the relentless spirit of the soldiers. Despite the odds, their focus remains unbroken, their commitment to their task unwavering.

As they finally manage to free the wagon from the clutches of the mud, their cheers are swallowed by the sound of the rain. Yet, in this moment of triumph, their spirits are lifted, a small victory against the overwhelming forces of nature and war.

CUT TO:

The soldiers, rallying around their success, prepare to continue their journey. Their faces, marked by exhaustion and relief, reflect the harsh realities of their world—where battles are fought not only against enemies but against the very elements themselves.

### Scene 10: The Copse

**EXT. THE COPSE - DAY**

The relentless rain continues, casting a veil over the landscape. Emerging from a thicket, JAMES and MOLL find themselves on the fringe of a small, dense copse, offering a vantage point over the scene of the bedraggled soldiers and their recently freed wagon.

JAMES, now fully revealed in his true identity to MOLL, surveys the scene with a tactical eye. His determination is palpable, a clear plan forming in his mind.

JAMES  
(resolute)  
Moll, we'll never have a better chance!

MOLL, ever the voice of caution and experience, eyes the first soldier warily.

MOLL  
(concerned)  
That first soldier worries me; he’s still armed.

JAMES assesses the soldier's position and readiness with a quick, practiced glance.

JAMES  
(confidently)  
He's facing the other way, and his weapon is exposed to the rain.

With a strategic mind and a clear understanding of the moment's advantage, JAMES checks the flintlock pistol at his side, ensuring it's ready for use despite the downpour. He then mounts his horse with a swift, practiced motion, a silent signal of their intent to confront.

MOLL follows JAMES's lead, her movements deliberate, her own readiness unspoken but evident. Together, they prepare to make their move, a coordinated effort born of trust and shared purpose.

As they approach the soldiers, the tension mounts. The element of surprise is on their side, but the risks are undeniable. The scene is set for a confrontation that could shift the balance in their favor or spell disaster.

CUT TO:

JAMES and MOLL, now in full view of the soldiers, poised for action. Their faces are masks of resolve, the stakes of their mission clear in their eyes. The moment before the confrontation is charged with potential, the outcome hanging in the balance.

### Scene 11: Confrontation

**EXT. MUDDY ROAD ON A HILLSIDE - DAY**

The soldiers, still grappling with their mired wagon, don't notice JAMES and MOLL's approach until it's too late. The rain continues to pour, adding to the chaos and their disadvantage.

SOLDIER  
(startled, defensive)  
What the hell are you all doing?

JAMES, calm and authoritative, steps forward, armed and undeterred by the soldiers' surprise.

JAMES  
(amused, yet firm)  
If it’s of any help, soldier, I can relieve you of some of your burden.

He reveals his pistol, signaling MOLL to emerge. The soldiers, now realizing they are outnumbered, wet, and at a disadvantage, hesitate, weighing their options.

JAMES  
(seriously)  
In the interests of your personal survival, may I suggest, sir, that you throw your pistol onto the road.

The soldiers, recognizing the futility of resistance, reluctantly comply, their weapons clattering onto the muddy road. JAMES, maintaining control, proposes a deal with a tone of finality.

JAMES  
Now, if you and your men would care to line up alongside the hedge, it will enable us to conclude our day’s business and be on our way.

As the soldiers line up as instructed, JAMES moves among them, inspecting them with a critical eye. He recognizes one from Colchester, a fact that seems to amuse him. He signals MOLL to collect their boots, ensuring their compliance and limiting their mobility.

JAMES  
(to the soldiers, with a parting shot)  
Farewell, sir. You should feel grateful that it is today we stopped you, for today we are naught but civilians plying our trade. Tomorrow, I ride to rejoin my Regiment in the King's Army, and had I been in uniform, your fates would have been somewhat different, as would the fate of your cargo.

With a final, meaningful glance, JAMES reveals his identity as Captain James Hind, leaving the soldiers in stunned silence, their minds racing to piece together the implications of this encounter.

JAMES and MOLL, having successfully concluded their business, depart from the scene with a sense of accomplishment and urgency, leaving behind a group of disarmed, bootless soldiers to ponder the encounter and its consequences.

### Scene 12: The Tavern

**INT. TAVERN - NIGHT**

The tavern is a hive of activity, smoky and loud, the air thick with the smells of ale and woodsmoke. The LANDLORD busies himself behind the bar, while a BARMAID wipes down tables. The chatter and laughter of HARLOTS and PATRONS mingle, creating a cacophony of revelry and debauchery.

JAMES enters, his presence cutting through the tavern's din like a ship parting waves. His eyes quickly scan the room, landing on MOLL, who is seated alone in a corner, a pipe in hand and a space reserved for strategy and conversation.

MOLL  
(seeing James, with a wry smile)  
Ah, Jimmy, welcome. Thomas said he’ll be here in a while, bringing in a new gang member.

JAMES signals for a drink and takes a seat across from MOLL, settling into the familiar comfort of their shared company. MOLL puffs on her pipe, the smoke swirling around her like a protective veil.

As if on cue, THOMAS and a group of MEN make their entrance, their arrival turning heads. THOMAS, the bearded leader, acknowledges JAMES with a wave and leads his group towards them.

JAMES  
(welcomingly)  
Thomas, welcome. You’ll be needing a drink.

He signals for drinks for everyone, the gesture both generous and telling of their camaraderie.

THOMAS  
(once seated, gets straight to the point)  
We need to expand the group. The Parliament fat cats have too many bodyguards when they travel.

JAMES  
(nods in agreement)  
Can't argue with that. The last few raids have been tough. I've had to do some solo raids on lesser fish. I'd rather rob the Roundheads!

Drinks arrive, distributed among the group, a momentary respite in the weighty discussion.

THOMAS  
(serious, introducing the newcomer)  
This is Zachary; they took his house and lands.

ZACHARY steps forward, his determination evident.

ZACHARY  
(eagerly)  
Pleased to meet you. With a gang like this, we can get rid of these Roundhead scum.

JAMES looks up sharply at Zachary's words, a hint of concern flickering in his eyes.

JAMES  
(calmly, but firmly)  
We're thieves and patriots, not assassins. Only kill if there's no other option.

ZACHARY  
(defiantly, but with a hint of respect)  
Whatever you say, boss.

JAMES  
(correcting him)  
Thomas is the boss. We rob, insult, embarrass, but we do not kill. I'll quit if we turn that corner.

Turning to THOMAS, JAMES reiterates his stance, a clear line drawn in the sand.

JAMES  
(sincerely)  
I'm not convinced our need is so great, but you're the boss.

THOMAS, acknowledging JAMES's concerns, turns to ZACHARY, reinforcing the code they live by.

THOMAS  
(firmly)  
James's counsel is crucial. We only kill if absolutely necessary.

ZACHARY's response is a smirk, his agreement non-verbal but clear.

ZACHARY  
(nonchalantly)  
If you say so.

The exchange of glares between JAMES and ZACHARY speaks volumes—a tension that simmers beneath the surface, hinting at the challenges and moral quandaries to come.
