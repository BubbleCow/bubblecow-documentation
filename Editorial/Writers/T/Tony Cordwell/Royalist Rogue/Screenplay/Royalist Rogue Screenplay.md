### Scene 1: Execution Day - January 1649

**EXT. WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY**

A bitter January chill grips the air. We find ourselves outside an Elizabethan house adjacent to Whitehall Palace. A sprawling square teems with onlookers, their breaths forming misty clouds. ROUGHLY CLAD TROOPS work diligently to hold back the burgeoning crowd. At the square's center, a sinister platform looms—complete with an executioner, his gleaming axe, and the ominous block.

KING CHARLES I emerges from the house, an image of defiance. He's clad in a hat, a cloak, and notably, two shirts to ward off the cold—a detail that speaks volumes. Soldiers swiftly encircle him, yet he maintains a brisk pace towards Whitehall, momentarily catching his escorts off guard with his resolve.

As he slows upon reaching the square, his eyes lock onto a MAN IN CAVALIER REGALIA, mounted on horseback among the sea of faces. A silent exchange passes between them—a nod, heavy with unspoken understanding.

Without breaking stride, KING CHARLES I continues on, entering the palace with the weight of his fate on his shoulders, leaving a palpable tension hanging over the square.
### Scene 2: A Last Glimpse

**EXT. WHITEHALL SQUARE - DAY**

The square is beginning to empty, the grim spectacle over. Near the entrance, the MAN IN CAVALIER REGALIA, now identified as JIMMY, is not alone. Beside him, an ELDERLY WOMAN, dignified and strong despite her age, sits astride her horse. Both of their faces are etched with grief and the weight of what they've just witnessed.

Tears carve silent paths down Jimmy's cheeks, the aftermath of a sorrow too deep for words. He turns to the woman, his voice barely above a whisper.

JIMMY  
Did you see that?

The woman nods, her own eyes glistening with unshed tears, yet her voice is steady, imbued with a somber resilience.

WOMAN  
I did. You will probably be the last friendly face he sees in this lifetime. Treasure that moment, Jimmy.

A resolve hardens in Jimmy's eyes, the tears drying in the cold air as determination takes their place. He clenches his fists, the weight of his resolve palpable.

JIMMY  
I shall. And I shall fight on until the cause is won!

The conviction in his voice rings out, a clarion call of defiance and loyalty in the face of despair. The elderly woman nods, a silent pact sealed between them. They turn their horses away from the square, their silhouettes stark against the setting sun, ready to continue the fight that the day's events have only deepened.

### Scene 3: On the Scaffold

**EXT. EXECUTION SITE - WHITEHALL - DAY**

The atmosphere is thick with anticipation and dread. SOLDIERS work with grim determination, pushing the gathered crowds back, ensuring a clear space around the execution platform. The air is cold, the mood somber.

Suddenly, the balcony doors swing open, and KING CHARLES I, accompanied by a BISHOP, steps onto the scaffold. The crowd, a mix of supporters, detractors, and the simply curious, watches in rapt silence.

KING CHARLES I, with a regal calmness that belies his situation, adjusts his hat and takes a moment to survey the scene before him. There's a profound solemnity in his gaze, a king facing his subjects for the last time.

KING CHARLES I  
(strong and clear)  
My people, understand that I seek your freedom. If I were willing to give way to rule by the sword, I would not be here. I am a martyr for my people. I go from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown.

His words echo across the silent square, each syllable laden with dignity and a haunting foreboding. This is not just the end of a king, but the closing of a chapter in the nation's history.

With solemn grace, CHARLES removes his hat and cloak, donning a simpler cap. He then kneels over the block, his body language one of acceptance and prayer. The bishop stands by, a silent sentinel in this moment of reverence.

The crowd, previously a cacophony of whispers and shuffling, falls into an even deeper silence, a collective breath held in anticipation and respect. The air seems to freeze, time itself pausing to witness this moment of profound sacrifice.

### Scene 4: The Execution

**EXT. EXECUTION SITE - WHITEHALL - DAY**

The camera sweeps over the silent, somber crowd, capturing a tableau of anticipation and dread. Faces are drawn, eyes wide, a collective entity holding its breath, united in this moment of history.

Then, in a singular, heart-stopping moment, the SOUND OF AN AXE CRASHING into the block echoes through the square, a grim punctuation that signifies the end of an era. The crowd, a moment ago wrapped in silence, lets out a terrible, communal groan—a sound that seems to carry the weight of the nation's sorrow, conflict, and tumult.

The camera lingers on the crowd's reaction, faces contorted in grief, shock, and for some, a grim resolution. In the immediate aftermath, there is a palpable shift, a sense of a pivotal moment passed, leaving an indelible mark on the collective psyche of a nation.

CUT TO:

The executioner, a figure now synonymous with the act just committed, stands silent, the axe by his side. The block, bearing the stark evidence of the act, remains in the center of the scaffold—a focal point of finality.

As the camera pulls back, the scaffold against the backdrop of Whitehall, the crowd, and the grey sky above, encapsulates the solemnity of the moment, the end of King Charles I's reign, and the profound uncertainty about what the future holds for England.

### Scene 5: Colchester as the Siege Ends

**EXT. COLCHESTER STREETS - DAY**

The narrow, winding streets of 17th Century Colchester are alive with the chaos and clamor of a city under siege. Crowds of anxious citizens and weary soldiers fill the thoroughfares, moving amidst the dirt and debris that mark the hardships of war.

Through this turbulent sea of people moves a solitary FEMALE FIGURE, her lower face obscured by scarves, blending yet distinct in her determination. Her pace is purposeful, yet cautious, as she navigates the crowded, uneven streets towards the town gate.

Suddenly, she's jostled by the crowd, an inadvertent shove sending her stumbling. As she falls, her skirts ride up, fleetingly revealing cavalry boots beneath—a stark contrast to her otherwise civilian guise. It's a moment of vulnerability, unnoticed by the throng around her.

Regaining her composure, she rises quickly, pressing her back against a wall. Her eyes dart around, alert, ready to defend herself if challenged. The moment passes without confrontation, and she resumes her journey, moving with renewed urgency.

As she approaches the gate, the throng thickens, the air tense with the anticipation of escape or capture. A SOLDIER, more interested in personal gratification than duty, reaches out to grope her as she passes. With a mixture of defiance and the need to remain undetected, she doesn't react aggressively but instead quickens her pace, slipping through the gate and out of his reach.

Once through the gate, the camera follows her as she distances herself from the soldier, the city, and the immediate danger. Her stride is quick and determined, the outskirts of Colchester offering a temporary respite as she merges with others seeking safety beyond the city's confines.

### Scene 6: Parliamentarian Camps

**EXT. PARLIAMENTARIAN CAMPS - DAY**

Just outside the gates of Colchester, the expansive Parliamentarian encampments sprawl across the landscape, a sea of tents and bustling activity. Smoke from numerous campfires curls into the sky, blurring the line between land and air, while the sounds of soldiers and horses fill the air with a constant, restless din.

The FEMALE FIGURE, having just passed through the city gate, now finds herself navigating a new maze: the crowded, chaotic encampments of the Parliamentarian troops. Her movements are cautious, deliberate, as she attempts to blend in while making her way through.

Suddenly, her path is blocked by a TROOPER, his intentions clear from his leering gaze. Despite her attempts to sidestep him and continue on her way, he reaches out, grabbing her arm, and drags her to the side.

SOLDIER  
(sneering)  
And where might you be going? You’ll have plenty of business when we enter tomorrow.

WOMAN  
(trying to maintain composure)  
I’m going to visit my sister. I’ll be back in a day or two.

SOLDIER  
(leering closer)  
Your sister doesn’t have what I have.

The situation escalates until a DARK FIGURE on a white horse approaches, the authority and urgency in his approach unmistakable.

HORSEMAN  
(sharp, commanding)  
What the Hell do you think you are doing, trooper?

The soldier snaps to attention, recognizing the authority in the horseman's voice. The camera reveals the horseman to be LORD FAIRFAX, a figure of command and respect among the troops.

FAIRFAX  
(calmly authoritative)  
You will release this woman now.

With a reluctant scowl, the trooper lets go of the woman, stepping back. Lord Fairfax then turns to the woman, his expression softening as he addresses her.

FAIRFAX  
(genuinely apologetic)  
I apologize for his behavior. You are free to go.

After ensuring the woman is unharmed and on her way, Fairfax turns his attention back to the trooper, his demeanor shifting from protector to disciplinarian. The trooper knows he's in for a reprimand as Fairfax begins to deal with him, a clear demonstration of leadership and integrity in the midst of war's chaos.

### Scene 7: Escape Through the Woodland

**EXT. WOODLAND - DAY**

The camera follows the WOMAN as she moves with a palpable sense of urgency, finally leaving the stifling atmosphere of the military encampments behind. The landscape shifts from the trampled earth of the camp to the dappled sunlight of the woodland. Here, the air is fresher, filled with the sounds of nature—a stark contrast to the tension and turmoil she's just escaped.

As she ventures deeper into the woods, the sounds of the camp fade away, replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant calls of birds. She slows, allowing herself a moment of relief, her shoulders visibly relaxing for the first time.

With a cautious glance around to ensure she's alone, she steps off the main road, finding solace in the seclusion of the trees. It's here, shielded from prying eyes by the woodland's embrace, that she begins to transform.

Piece by piece, the woman's attire is shed, revealing the truth hidden beneath—a truth not just of identity, but of defiance and resilience. JAMES stands where the woman once was, his disguise discarded along with the vulnerability it implied.

JAMES  
(under his breath, with resolve)  
Freedom lies not in the open road, but in the paths we dare to carve from the wilderness.

With a final glance back towards the way he came, James turns and delves deeper into the woodland, his stride confident, his direction sure. He is a man on a mission, driven by a purpose that the confines of society—or its expectations—cannot contain.

CUT TO:

James, now far removed from the dangers of the camp and the road, moves with the ease of one familiar with the hidden trails and secret ways of the land. The woodland is not just an escape; it's a route to somewhere—or to someone—significant, a part of a larger plan set into motion.

### Scene 8: Reunion with Moll

**EXT. WOODLAND CLEARING - DAY**

A secluded clearing in the woodland serves as the backdrop for this scene, where a rickety shed stands as a testament to the secrecy and urgency of these times. The door is ajar, revealing a dimly lit interior.

JAMES, having shed his female disguise but still donning the remnants of his escape attire, arrives at the clearing. He approaches the shed with a familiarity borne of many such meetings in the past.

Inside, MOLL, an elderly woman with a steely gaze and an unyielding posture, is seated at a makeshift table littered with maps and documents. She looks up as James enters, her surprise evident at his appearance.

ELDERLY WOMAN (MOLL)  
(shocked)  
James, what in the name of God are you wearing?

JAMES  
(with a wry smile)  
It was the only way I could escape. Soldiers kept trying to hire me along the way – I ended up being released by Lord Fairfax.

MOLL  
(chuckling despite herself)  
Well, you’ll have to find some proper clothes. I have a reputation to uphold.

JAMES  
(jokingly)  
I’ll steal some along the way.

MOLL  
(sarcastically)  
Your reputation wouldn't survive being recognized like that either. Where did you get those clothes, from, a brothel?

JAMES  
(slightly embarrassed)  
Well, yes.

MOLL  
(taking charge)  
No wonder you were accosted! Let's get moving; we don't want to be near that ragtag army.

As MOLL stands, she gathers a few essential items from the table, stuffing them into a bag with efficiency and care. JAMES, still amused at their banter, follows suit, preparing for the journey ahead. Together, they step out of the shed, ready to face whatever challenges lie on the road before them.

Their interaction, a blend of humor, concern, and mutual respect, highlights the depth of their relationship. As they disappear into the woodland, their silhouettes fading into the foliage, the scene underscores the gravity of their situation and the resilience of those committed to their cause.

### Scene 9: A Muddy Road on the Side of a Hill

**EXT. MUDDY ROAD ON A HILLSIDE - DAY**

The relentless downpour transforms the landscape into a sodden tableau. Amidst this deluge, a SMALL TROOP OF FIVE BEDRAGGLED SOLDIERS battles with a wagon mired in the mud. Their efforts are desperate, their movements frenetic against the backdrop of the pouring rain, which reduces visibility to nearly nothing.

The soldiers, their uniforms soaked through and clinging to their bodies, work in unison but with growing frustration. They place planks under the wagon's wheels, a makeshift attempt to gain traction in the relentless muck.

SOLDIER 1  
(shouting over the rain)  
On three! One... two... three!

They heave against the wagon with a unified grunt, their faces set in grim determination. The wagon budges slightly, an inch of progress bought with an immense effort.

SOLDIER 2  
(voice strained)  
Again! Push!

The rain intensifies, as if nature itself challenges their resolve. The planks slip, betraying their efforts, but the soldiers refuse to yield. With each attempt, they reclaim a bit more ground, a testament to their determination not to be defeated by mud and weather.

SOLDIER 3  
(gasping for breath)  
We're not letting this damn rain stop us!

Their camaraderie and shared struggle against the elements highlight the relentless spirit of the soldiers. Despite the odds, their focus remains unbroken, their commitment to their task unwavering.

As they finally manage to free the wagon from the clutches of the mud, their cheers are swallowed by the sound of the rain. Yet, in this moment of triumph, their spirits are lifted, a small victory against the overwhelming forces of nature and war.

CUT TO:

The soldiers, rallying around their success, prepare to continue their journey. Their faces, marked by exhaustion and relief, reflect the harsh realities of their world—where battles are fought not only against enemies but against the very elements themselves.

### Scene 10: The Copse

**EXT. THE COPSE - DAY**

The relentless rain continues, casting a veil over the landscape. Emerging from a thicket, JAMES and MOLL find themselves on the fringe of a small, dense copse, offering a vantage point over the scene of the bedraggled soldiers and their recently freed wagon.

JAMES, now fully revealed in his true identity to MOLL, surveys the scene with a tactical eye. His determination is palpable, a clear plan forming in his mind.

JAMES  
(resolute)  
Moll, we'll never have a better chance!

MOLL, ever the voice of caution and experience, eyes the first soldier warily.

MOLL  
(concerned)  
That first soldier worries me; he’s still armed.

JAMES assesses the soldier's position and readiness with a quick, practiced glance.

JAMES  
(confidently)  
He's facing the other way, and his weapon is exposed to the rain.

With a strategic mind and a clear understanding of the moment's advantage, JAMES checks the flintlock pistol at his side, ensuring it's ready for use despite the downpour. He then mounts his horse with a swift, practiced motion, a silent signal of their intent to confront.

MOLL follows JAMES's lead, her movements deliberate, her own readiness unspoken but evident. Together, they prepare to make their move, a coordinated effort born of trust and shared purpose.

As they approach the soldiers, the tension mounts. The element of surprise is on their side, but the risks are undeniable. The scene is set for a confrontation that could shift the balance in their favor or spell disaster.

CUT TO:

JAMES and MOLL, now in full view of the soldiers, poised for action. Their faces are masks of resolve, the stakes of their mission clear in their eyes. The moment before the confrontation is charged with potential, the outcome hanging in the balance.

### Scene 11: Confrontation

**EXT. MUDDY ROAD ON A HILLSIDE - DAY**

The soldiers, still grappling with their mired wagon, don't notice JAMES and MOLL's approach until it's too late. The rain continues to pour, adding to the chaos and their disadvantage.

SOLDIER  
(startled, defensive)  
What the hell are you all doing?

JAMES, calm and authoritative, steps forward, armed and undeterred by the soldiers' surprise.

JAMES  
(amused, yet firm)  
If it’s of any help, soldier, I can relieve you of some of your burden.

He reveals his pistol, signaling MOLL to emerge. The soldiers, now realizing they are outnumbered, wet, and at a disadvantage, hesitate, weighing their options.

JAMES  
(seriously)  
In the interests of your personal survival, may I suggest, sir, that you throw your pistol onto the road.

The soldiers, recognizing the futility of resistance, reluctantly comply, their weapons clattering onto the muddy road. JAMES, maintaining control, proposes a deal with a tone of finality.

JAMES  
Now, if you and your men would care to line up alongside the hedge, it will enable us to conclude our day’s business and be on our way.

As the soldiers line up as instructed, JAMES moves among them, inspecting them with a critical eye. He recognizes one from Colchester, a fact that seems to amuse him. He signals MOLL to collect their boots, ensuring their compliance and limiting their mobility.

JAMES  
(to the soldiers, with a parting shot)  
Farewell, sir. You should feel grateful that it is today we stopped you, for today we are naught but civilians plying our trade. Tomorrow, I ride to rejoin my Regiment in the King's Army, and had I been in uniform, your fates would have been somewhat different, as would the fate of your cargo.

With a final, meaningful glance, JAMES reveals his identity as Captain James Hind, leaving the soldiers in stunned silence, their minds racing to piece together the implications of this encounter.

JAMES and MOLL, having successfully concluded their business, depart from the scene with a sense of accomplishment and urgency, leaving behind a group of disarmed, bootless soldiers to ponder the encounter and its consequences.

### Scene 12: The Tavern

**INT. TAVERN - NIGHT**

The tavern is a hive of activity, smoky and loud, the air thick with the smells of ale and woodsmoke. The LANDLORD busies himself behind the bar, while a BARMAID wipes down tables. The chatter and laughter of HARLOTS and PATRONS mingle, creating a cacophony of revelry and debauchery.

JAMES enters, his presence cutting through the tavern's din like a ship parting waves. His eyes quickly scan the room, landing on MOLL, who is seated alone in a corner, a pipe in hand and a space reserved for strategy and conversation.

MOLL  
(seeing James, with a wry smile)  
Ah, Jimmy, welcome. Thomas said he’ll be here in a while, bringing in a new gang member.

JAMES signals for a drink and takes a seat across from MOLL, settling into the familiar comfort of their shared company. MOLL puffs on her pipe, the smoke swirling around her like a protective veil.

As if on cue, THOMAS and a group of MEN make their entrance, their arrival turning heads. THOMAS, the bearded leader, acknowledges JAMES with a wave and leads his group towards them.

JAMES  
(welcomingly)  
Thomas, welcome. You’ll be needing a drink.

He signals for drinks for everyone, the gesture both generous and telling of their camaraderie.

THOMAS  
(once seated, gets straight to the point)  
We need to expand the group. The Parliament fat cats have too many bodyguards when they travel.

JAMES  
(nods in agreement)  
Can't argue with that. The last few raids have been tough. I've had to do some solo raids on lesser fish. I'd rather rob the Roundheads!

Drinks arrive, distributed among the group, a momentary respite in the weighty discussion.

THOMAS  
(serious, introducing the newcomer)  
This is Zachary; they took his house and lands.

ZACHARY steps forward, his determination evident.

ZACHARY  
(eagerly)  
Pleased to meet you. With a gang like this, we can get rid of these Roundhead scum.

JAMES looks up sharply at Zachary's words, a hint of concern flickering in his eyes.

JAMES  
(calmly, but firmly)  
We're thieves and patriots, not assassins. Only kill if there's no other option.

ZACHARY  
(defiantly, but with a hint of respect)  
Whatever you say, boss.

JAMES  
(correcting him)  
Thomas is the boss. We rob, insult, embarrass, but we do not kill. I'll quit if we turn that corner.

Turning to THOMAS, JAMES reiterates his stance, a clear line drawn in the sand.

JAMES  
(sincerely)  
I'm not convinced our need is so great, but you're the boss.

THOMAS, acknowledging JAMES's concerns, turns to ZACHARY, reinforcing the code they live by.

THOMAS  
(firmly)  
James's counsel is crucial. We only kill if absolutely necessary.

ZACHARY's response is a smirk, his agreement non-verbal but clear.

ZACHARY  
(nonchalantly)  
If you say so.

The exchange of glares between JAMES and ZACHARY speaks volumes—a tension that simmers beneath the surface, hinting at the challenges and moral quandaries to come.

### Scene 13: James's Family Cottage

**INT. JAMES'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT**

The cottage, cozy and dimly lit, exudes warmth. Various areas are delineated by curtains, creating a semblance of rooms within the single large space. JAMES sits contemplatively by the fire, the flames casting dancing shadows across his face.

His WIFE, a figure of concern and love, sits opposite him. Her question hangs in the air, filled with worry and a longing for a simpler life.

WIFE  
(softly, with concern)  
Why do you do these things, James? Could you not take a lawful profession?

JAMES  
(looking into the fire, reflective)  
They know who I am; I oppose them. I cannot stay in one place for long.

WIFE  
(hopefully)  
There must be professions allowing you to move around.

JAMES  
(pondering the notion, then with a hint of mystery)  
Perhaps, but I walk under the protection of a spell.

The word 'spell' catches his wife's attention, her curiosity piqued amidst her concern.

WIFE  
(intrigued)  
A spell?

JAMES  
(leaning closer, sharing a secret)  
Three years ago, an old woman granted me protection. A charm to keep me safe.

He proceeds to explain the charm, its origins, and its supposed powers. Though it's clear his wife harbors doubts, her love and belief in him transcend skepticism.

WIFE  
(gently, her voice laced with worry)  
Be careful, my love.

JAMES  
(resolute, yet tender)  
I will. But I must leave soon; Bradshaw is to travel, and I want a word with him.

The weight of his duty is evident in his voice, a testament to the path he's chosen—or perhaps, the path that has chosen him.

WIFE  
(sincerely, with a touch of fear)  
Take care.

JAMES stretches, his movements reflecting a readiness to face whatever lies ahead. He prepares to leave, his determination and the dangers that await him palpable in the air.

As he steps out into the night, the door closing behind him, his wife watches from the window, a silent prayer on her lips for his safe return.

### Scene 14: Narrow Lane between Sherborne and Shaftesbury

**EXT. NARROW LANE BETWEEN SHERBORNE AND SHAFTESBURY - DAY**

A carriage, opulent and unmistakably of the upper class, speeds along a narrow, tree-lined lane. The rumble of its wheels and the steady trot of horses disrupt the natural tranquility. Two GUARDS, vigilant and armed, flank the carriage, their eyes scanning the surroundings for any sign of trouble.

Without warning, the serenity is shattered as JAMES and HIS GANG emerge from the shadows, their presence an immediate and undeniable threat. The ambush is swift, a well-coordinated assault that brings the carriage to a halt with startling efficiency.

JAMES, the figurehead of this daring ensemble, steps forward. His posture is one of authority, his intent clear in his steady gaze. The guards, caught off guard but quickly regaining their composure, reach for their weapons, ready to defend their charge.

The standoff is tense, a moment suspended in time where the outcome hangs in the balance. The guards assess their odds, the weight of their duty heavy upon them. JAMES, however, remains undeterred, his confidence in his cause and his companions unwavering.

JAMES  
(calmly, with an edge of command)  
Gentlemen, I suggest you reconsider. This doesn't have to end in bloodshed.

The message is clear: the guards face overwhelming odds, and resistance may only lead to unnecessary violence. The tension crackles in the air, a silent battle of wills playing out beneath the canopy of trees.

After a tense moment, the guards lower their weapons, recognizing the futility of their position. JAMES nods in approval, a signal for his gang to proceed. They quickly and efficiently relieve the carriage and its occupants of valuables, their movements practiced and precise.

As the gang concludes their raid, JAMES offers a final, parting glance to the guards, a silent acknowledgment of the unspoken agreement that has spared bloodshed this day.

JAMES  
(to his gang, as they prepare to depart)  
Let's move out. Our business here is done.

With a sense of accomplishment mingled with the adrenaline of the encounter, JAMES and his gang disappear back into the landscape, leaving the carriage and its shaken occupants to continue on their journey, albeit lighter in possessions.

The ambush, though brief, leaves an indelible mark on those involved, a reminder of the tumultuous times they navigate and the shadowy figures who move just beyond the reach of law and order.

### Scene 15: Inside the Carriage

**INT. CARRIAGE - DAY**

The carriage, once a sanctuary of wealth and privilege, now serves as the stage for a tense confrontation. JOHN BRADSHAW, richly attired, faces JAMES, who stands with the confidence of a man on a mission.

JAMES  
(announcing himself with a mix of irony and gravity)  
Captain James Hind at your service. You brought money for me.

BRADSHAW, incredulous and indignant, recognizes neither the authority nor the threat posed by James.

BRADSHAW  
(indignant, with a hint of fear)  
Do you not know who I am? You shall hang for this sir, I shall have you hunted down and, yes, I shall sit in judgement myself and see to it.

JAMES, unflinching, meets Bradshaw's threats with a cold, unwavering gaze.

JAMES  
(calmly, with a dangerous edge)  
I shall not, and you shall not, sir. I do not fear you, or any other king-killing son of a whore still alive. At this moment, I have as much power over you as you recently had over our king, and I would be doing God and my country a service were I to use my power as you did. Nevertheless, I prefer to let you live, villain, to suffer the pangs of your own conscience until justice shall lay her iron hand upon you and demand an answer for your crimes. You are not worthy to die at any other hand but that of the common hangman, or at any place other than Tyburn. But if you do not hand over your money immediately, I shall not hesitate to send you to your maker without benefit of any clergy.

Bradshaw, recognizing the futility of resistance and the genuine threat before him, reluctantly hands over his purse. JAMES, with a flair for the theatrical, extracts a gold coin, holding it up to the light, his contempt for Bradshaw's values clear in his words.

JAMES  
(holding up the coin, with scorn)  
Ah, indeed sir. This metal could win my heart forever. Oh, precious Gold! I admire you as much as Bradshaw, and all the other villainous parliamentarians do; the difference is that whilst they would sell the Lord Jesus for your sake, I would not.

JAMES turns back to BRADSHAW, his disdain palpable, delivering a scathing critique of the corrupting power of gold.

JAMES  
(derisively)  
Do you know, I am sure that this gold is the substance which you Republicans call a wonder potion. It makes justice blind; it removes the deepest treason far more effectively than soap can remove the stains of a poor man’s labours. In a word, it turns fools into wise men and wise men into fools, and both into knaves. The colour of this precious balm is, as you see, bright and dazzling, and if applied quietly into the right hand in the proper dosage can perform all of these wonders and much, much more.

With that, JAMES returns the coin to the purse and secures it in his pocket. Raising his pistols, he fixes BRADSHAW with a look that conveys both a warning and a promise.

JAMES  
(firmly, with a finality that brooks no argument)  
Until now, you and your infernal friends have run around acting as if you were some sort of messiahs. I believe that the time has now come to stop your careers.

The terror in BRADSHAW's eyes is unmistakable, a dark stain spreading across his breeches serving as a testament to his fear. JAMES, with a laugh that echoes the triumph of the underdog over the corrupt elite, spurs his horse to the front of the coach, leaving behind a shaken and humiliated Bradshaw.

### Scene 16: Aftermath

**EXT. NARROW LANE BETWEEN SHERBORNE AND SHAFTESBURY - DAY**

The carriage stands immobilized, its occupants shaken by the recent confrontation. The gang, having completed their raid, gathers for a moment, the spoils of their endeavor secured. The tension from within the carriage spills out into their midst, highlighted by ZACHARY's impetuousness.

ZACHARY  
(impatient, with a hint of aggression)  
Why are we pussyfooting around? We should kill these vermin while we have the chance.

JAMES, ever the leader, responds with a calm that belies the gravity of their actions.

JAMES  
(firmly, with authority)  
We have no argument with these men, only with he who they guard.

ZACHARY, not easily deterred, pushes back, his desire for retribution clear.

ZACHARY  
(urgently)  
So, let’s kill him, then!

THOMAS, the voice of reason and experience, intervenes, his words carrying the weight of their shared history and the code they live by.

THOMAS  
(resolute, with finality)  
No. If James says no, we don’t do it; it’s how we’ve survived so long, and you are not going to spoil it.

The decision made, the gang prepares to leave. JAMES, in a final act that ensures their escape and leaves a message behind, takes aim and shoots the horses tethered to the carriage. The act is quick, merciful, and strategic, severing the last tie that could have led their pursuers directly to them.

With the money taken and their message delivered, the gang mounts their horses. The ride away is swift, a collective movement of shadows retreating back into the landscape from which they emerged. They leave behind a scene of calculated chaos, a testament to their principles, their survival, and the lengths they will go to protect their own.

The air of victory is tempered by the underlying tensions within the gang, a reminder of the delicate balance between their ideals and the realities of their crusade.

### Scene 17: James's Parents' Courtyard

**EXT. JAMES'S PARENTS' COURTYARD - DAY**

The sun bathes the courtyard in a gentle, warm light, casting long shadows that dance across the cobblestones. The serene, pastoral setting is a stark contrast to the tumultuous events that unfolded just scenes before.

JAMES emerges from the stable, the bond between him and his horse evident in the affectionate pat he gives the animal before parting. His actions are unhurried, a man momentarily at peace in familiar surroundings.

As he turns to leave the stable, JAMES's gaze is drawn to the window of the small, simple cottage that stands as a testament to his roots. There, framed by the window, is his MOTHER, her eyes filled with a mixture of concern, love, and quiet pride.

Their eyes meet, and a warm, unspoken understanding passes between them. JAMES's smile broadens, a silent acknowledgment of the worries she carries for him, tempered by the joy of seeing her son return home, even if only for a moment.

With a lightness in his step, JAMES strolls across the yard, each step taking him closer to the familial embrace that awaits. The simple act of walking from the stable to the cottage is imbued with a sense of returning, of grounding, after the high stakes and adrenaline of his recent exploits.

He reaches the cottage door, pausing for a moment to take in the scene, the normalcy of home a sharp contrast to his life on the road. Then, with a final glance back at the stable and the world beyond, JAMES enters the cottage, stepping into the warmth and safety it represents.
### Scene 18: Interior - James's Parents' Cottage - Day (Revised)

**INT. JAMES'S PARENTS' COTTAGE - DAY**

The cottage, warm and inviting, bathes in the soft glow of daylight filtering through small windows. The air inside is thick with the smell of fresh baking, a homely scent that speaks of simpler times and familial love.

Upon seeing JAMES enter, his MOTHER, a portly woman brimming with affection and concern, lights up with unmistakable joy. She moves towards him with open arms, her movements quick with anticipation.

MOTHER  
(beaming with happiness)  
James! What a delight. I see so little of you these days.

She envelops him in a tight hug, a gesture that conveys years of worry, love, and the silent strength of a mother's love.

JAMES  
(returning the hug, with a lightness in his voice)  
Ah, I am very busy. My line of work means that I must travel long distances, but it pays the bills. Margaret rarely wants for anything, and my children seem to have grown every time I return!

MOTHER  
(slightly chiding but with warmth)  
Such is the way with children and as they grow, their demands grow with them. However, they do need a father around. Your father was always here for you.

JAMES  
(pondering, with a touch of humor)  
Indeed he was, but my strongest memories of my father have him holding a strap.

MOTHER  
(laughing softly, shaking her head)  
You were so undisciplined, it was needed.

JAMES  
(smiling)  
All children are undisciplined. It is only by pushing the boundaries that a child learns where they are.

MOTHER  
(changing the subject, with practicality)  
Are you hungry? I just finished my baking, there is hot bread waiting there on the table.

JAMES  
(standing, with determination)  
No, mother, I am anxious to spend more time with Maggie and the children. I hope to remain at home for a few weeks over Christmas.

MOTHER  
(concerned, yet with a hint of defiance)  
You do not intend to celebrate Christmas, do you? You know that Parliament made it illegal.

JAMES  
(resolute, with a spark of defiance)  
Mother, I have spent the past seven years fighting Parliament and their hideous laws of repression. Do you really think I intend to deprive my children of the joy of celebrating the birth of Christ?

MOTHER  
(worriedly)  
Do be careful. They are getting quite strict now.

JAMES  
(assuringly)  
Mother, they will be too busy celebrating Christmas themselves; you surely do not believe that the ban on Christmas celebrations was intended for themselves? It was aimed solely at the poor.

MOTHER  
(teasingly, but with a touch of caution)  
Your perception may be a little biased, my son. But be careful, nevertheless.

JAMES  
(reassuringly)  
I shall mother. But now I must go home, I have been missing Maggie sorely.

MOTHER  
(softly)  
And she you. She visits us regularly. More regularly than do you.

JAMES  
(half-joking, half-serious)  
I have no choice. But I must go. Pass my regards to father.

MOTHER  
(sincerely)  
I shall.

As JAMES heads towards the door, his MOTHER blows him a kiss, a gesture filled with love and the unspoken worries of a parent. The door closes gently behind him, leaving her in the silent warmth of the cottage, her thoughts undoubtedly following him out into the wider world.

As JAMES heads towards the door, his MOTHER blows him a kiss, a gesture filled with love and the unspoken worries of a parent. The door closes gently behind him, leaving her in the silent warmth of the cottage, her thoughts undoubtedly following him out into the wider world.

### Scene 19: Interior - James's Home - Day (Revised)

**INT. JAMES'S HOME - DAY**

The scene unfolds in the cozy, bustling interior of JAMES's home, where life and love overflow in every corner. As JAMES steps through the door, his world transforms from one of danger and duty to one of family and warmth. BABY CHARLES giggles in delight at the sight of his father, a sound that fills the room with pure joy.

ALICE, a spirited 9-year-old with eyes full of mischief, immediately seizes her chance, her voice a blend of hope and strategy.

ALICE  
(excitedly)  
Father, can I ride your horse?

JAMES, balancing the roles of doting father and disciplinarian, responds with a gentle reminder of responsibilities.

JAMES  
(firmly, but with a smile)  
You must clean the kitchen first, young lady, just like your mother told you a while ago.

ALICE, undeterred, tries her luck with a drawn-out plea, her eyes wide with the universal language of childlike bargaining.

ALICE  
(drawling)  
Pleeeease?

JAMES  
(amused, but unwavering)  
Clean first, ride second.

ALICE shuffles off towards the kitchen, her resolve switching from pleading to action, in search of the cleaning rag. Meanwhile, a YOUNGER BROTHER's curiosity leads him towards JAMES’s gun, a moment of innocence flirting dangerously with peril.

MAGGIE, ever the vigilant mother, addresses the risk with a calm urgency, her concern for their safety paramount.

MAGGIE  
(worriedly)  
I do wish you would take those off in the house, Jimmy. It only takes a moment of distraction, and we could have a disaster on our hands.

JAMES acknowledges her wisdom with a nod, the constant tension between his life's demands and his family's safety weighing heavily on him.

JAMES  
(conceding)  
You’re right, my love, as always. But sadly, I have to leave shortly.

He carefully removes his weapons, placing them out of reach on a high shelf beside the fireplace, a temporary measure in a life where danger is a constant companion.

In a moment of levity, JAMES scoops up the two young boys, transforming into a playful steed, their laughter a balm to the soul's weariness. MAGGIE's laughter joins theirs, a reminder of the joy amidst the chaos.

MAGGIE  
(laughing, mock chiding)  
Stop that! You’ll make them sick!

JAMES, reveling in the normalcy of family life, retorts with feigned indignation, his heart light for the moment.

JAMES  
(playfully)  
I finally get time to spend with my family, and I’m not allowed to play with them!

The moment is fleeting, as JAMES’s duty calls him away once more. He prepares to leave, the weight of parting heavy on his shoulders.

JAMES  
(solemnly, to MAGGIE)  
I must move on now. I was hoping to be able to spend a little time with you, but apparently, it is not to be. I must report to the king across the water, so it may well be a while before I return. I have some money for you.

He hands her a bag, the practicalities of their life together mingling with the tenderness of their farewell.

JAMES  
(seriously)  
I suggest you bury it beneath the stone in the garden in case they do decide to search. But now I really must leave. Goodbye, my love, I shall be counting the days until my return.

Their kiss is a seal on promises made and kept, a testament to their enduring bond. JAMES takes a moment with each child, a hug, a smile, a silent vow of return.

With a final, loving glance at his family, JAMES steps back into the world outside, his departure marked by the careful avoidance of prying eyes, the perpetual balance between the man he is and the duties he bears.

### Scene 20: Interior - Inn - Night

**INT. INN - NIGHT**

The inn is a cacophony of life and excess, a stark contrast to the dark and dangerous world outside its walls. Smoke from pipes curls upwards, mingling with the laughter and shouts of the patrons. Amidst this revelry, JAMES, THOMAS, ZACHARY, and MOLL sit secluded at a table, their world a bubble within the chaos, lit by the intermittent dance of candlelight.

THOMAS, always the strategist, leans in, lowering his voice to ensure their conversation remains confidential amidst the surrounding noise.

THOMAS  
(serious, conveying urgency)  
Fairfax will be passing through Hounslow Heath next Wednesday. He travels light, without much of a guard.

ZACHARY, his eyes alight with the fire of retribution, sees an opportunity not just for gain but for vengeance.

ZACHARY  
(determined, almost zealous)  
Then it's the perfect opportunity to strike. Fairfax deserves retribution for his deeds during the war.

JAMES, however, remains the voice of reason, his perspective shaped by years of navigating the precarious balance between cause and survival.

JAMES  
(earnest, resolute)  
We're not here to settle scores. Killing Fairfax will only escalate tensions.

ZACHARY's retort is sharp, a challenge not just to JAMES's plan but to his character.

ZACHARY  
(derisive, challenging)  
Soft words from a man who's lost his edge.

JAMES, unfazed, his authority and conviction clear, counters with the wisdom of experience.

JAMES  
(firmly, with a calm authority)  
I've survived this long by avoiding unnecessary bloodshed.

THOMAS intervenes, his voice cutting through the tension like a knife. The decision is final, a command that brooks no argument.

THOMAS  
(authoritatively)  
Enough! We rob him, but we don't take lives unless absolutely necessary.

ZACHARY's glare towards JAMES is laden with unspoken threats and disagreements, but the matter is settled. JAMES's gaze, steady and unwavering, meets ZACHARY's challenge without flinching.

ZACHARY  
(reluctantly, with a hint of disdain)  
If you say so.

The conversation dwindles into a tense silence, each member of the group lost in thought, contemplating the heist ahead. The plans are laid, the roles defined, but the undercurrent of dissent and the moral dilemmas they face loom large in the flickering candlelight.

As they sit in silence, the inn's raucous atmosphere fades into the background, a reminder of the world that continues unaware of the dangerous plans being forged within its midst.

### Scene 21: Exterior - Hounslow Heath - Day

**EXT. HOUNSLOW HEATH - DAY**

The vast expanse of Hounslow Heath unfolds under a pale sunlight, its desolation marked by sparse shrubbery and the occasional tree. The tranquility of the scene is disrupted as FAIRFAX's carriage, a symbol of authority and power, emerges on the horizon, flanked by a modest retinue of guards.

In the shadows, JAMES and his gang prepare their ambush, their movements calculated and silent as the carriage approaches.

JAMES  
(whispering, with determined caution)  
Now's our chance. Remember, we take the money and leave Fairfax unharmed.

With precision, the gang springs into action, their presence a sudden and formidable barrier to the carriage's progress. The guards, caught off guard, are quickly overpowered, forced to surrender without bloodshed. FAIRFAX, composed and seemingly unfazed by the ambush, steps out of the carriage to confront his assailants.

FAIRFAX  
(calm, authoritative)  
Ah, highwaymen. What brings you to Hounslow Heath?

ZACHARY, driven by a thirst for vengeance, steps forward, pistol aimed at FAIRFAX, his intentions clear.

ZACHARY  
(vengeful, with bitter resolve)  
Justice, Fairfax. For the lives lost at Colchester.

As ZACHARY's finger tightens on the trigger, JAMES intervenes, his hand blocking the shot in a moment of chaos. Gunfire erupts, and in the confusion, THOMAS takes a bullet meant for JAMES. ZACHARY, realizing the gravity of his actions, drops his weapon and flees into the heath, while MOLL is captured by FAIRFAX's men.

FAIRFAX  
(to his men, coldly)  
Take her into custody. She'll face trial for her crimes.

MOLL, defiant even in capture, is dragged before FAIRFAX, who regards her with a mixture of disdain and calculated interest.

FAIRFAX  
(considering, with a hint of negotiation)  
Your fate is sealed, madam. But perhaps there's room for negotiation.

MOLL, undeterred by FAIRFAX's gaze, meets his eyes with a steely resolve.

MOLL  
(determined, unyielding)  
Name your price.

FAIRFAX pauses, weighing his options before laying out his terms, his voice betraying no emotion.

FAIRFAX  
(firm, calculating)  
Two thousand pounds. But don't think you'll see freedom until I have it in my hands.

MOLL nods, her determination unfazed by the steep price of her freedom.

MOLL  
(resolute, agreeing)  
Agreed. You'll have your money.

FAIRFAX signals for MOLL to be taken away, his expression unreadable, a master of concealing his thoughts as he watches the consequences of their confrontation unfold.

As the carriage resumes its journey and the gang regroups, the heath returns to its quiet desolation, the echoes of the day's events lingering in the air.

### Scene 22: Interior - Inn - Night

**INT. INN - NIGHT**

The inn is dimly lit, the atmosphere heavy with the smell of ale and the murmur of conversations. JAMES sits alone at a table, a half-empty mug of ale before him. The passing hours are marked by the level of ale in his mug, each sip a testament to his growing anxiety.

JAMES  
(muttering to himself, fraught with worry)  
Where is she?

His thoughts are a turbulent sea, crashing with fears for MOLL's safety and guilt for having left without her.

JAMES  
(voice tinged with dread)  
Have they taken her? Or worse, killed her?

He downs another gulp of ale, the bitter liquid doing little to quench his dread. Lost in thought, JAMES barely notices the approach of a GRUBBY URCHIN, the child's appearance a stark contrast to the inn's patrons.

URCHIN  
(timidly, yet with a hint of boldness)  
Is you the captain?

JAMES, cautious, eyes the child, weighing his words carefully.

JAMES  
(measuringly)  
It rather depends upon who is asking and why.

URCHIN, undeterred by JAMES's guarded tone, relays his message with the earnestness only a child can muster.

URCHIN  
(hopefully)  
Oh, Moll asked me to find the captain and ask him to visit her in Newgate. Gave me a penny and said 'e'd give me one too.

The boy extends his hand expectantly, his eyes gleaming with the prospect of another penny. JAMES, intrigued yet still cautious, decides to test the urchin's truthfulness.

JAMES  
(slyly, with a hint of a challenge)  
Not so fast. Tell me more. The happier I am, the more your penny grows.

URCHIN, eager to please for the right price, elaborates with the simplicity of his years.

URCHIN  
(enthusiastically)  
Jailer told me to go see this lady in Newgate. She told me to come 'ere and find the captain. Tell 'im to visit 'er in Newgate. She give me a penny, said you would give me another.

Again, the hand extends, the promise of payment hanging between them. JAMES, now satisfied but still playing his part, poses one final question.

JAMES  
(curtly)  
Not so fast. What colour were her eyes?

URCHIN, without missing a beat, answers confidently.

URCHIN  
(with certainty)  
Easy. Blue.

JAMES, convinced and somewhat relieved, retrieves two pennies, placing them in the eager hand of the urchin.

JAMES  
(softly, more to himself)  
Very well.

The boy grins, his mission accomplished, and quickly disappears into the night. JAMES watches him go, a mix of emotions churning within. The weight of the situation settles on him with newfound urgency.

JAMES  
(determined, under his breath)  
Moll needs me.

With a resolve hardened by the boy's message, JAMES finishes his ale and rises from the table. The mission is clear, and time is of the essence. He prepares to embark on his journey to Newgate Prison, the stakes higher than ever.

### Scene 23: Exterior - Streets of London - Night

**EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT**

The night envelops London, its streets a labyrinth of shadows and flickering lamplight. Emerging from the inn, JAMES cuts a striking figure, his attire transformed to that of a flamboyant dandy. The elaborate wig sits atop his head, and his face is powdered to perfection, a disguise meant to navigate the city's streets unseen by those who might recognize him.

JAMES  
(under his breath, with determination)  
For Moll.

He sets off with a stride that belies the weight of his thoughts. The streets teem with life even at this hour, merchants closing their stalls, late-night revelers stumbling from pubs, and the ever-present undercurrent of those who call the shadows home.

As JAMES navigates through the bustling streets, his mind is solely on MOLL. Each step is laden with concern for her well-being, her safety a constant echo in his thoughts. The transformation in his appearance serves not only as a shield from prying eyes but as a testament to the lengths he will go to ensure her safety.

The journey to Newgate Prison is a silent vow, a mission born of loyalty and the deep bonds forged in the fires of their shared struggles. The city around him, with its cacophony of sounds and blur of faces, fades into the background as his focus narrows to the task at hand.

JAMES moves with a purpose that draws little attention, his disguise blending seamlessly with the colorful characters that populate London's night. The closer he gets to Newgate, the more the anticipation builds, a tight knot of anxiety and resolve forming in the pit of his stomach.

As the formidable silhouette of Newgate Prison looms ahead, a fortress of despair in the heart of the city, JAMES steadies himself. The night ahead will be fraught with danger and uncertainty, but for MOLL, for their cause, he is willing to face it all.

### Scene 24: Exterior - Newgate Prison - Night

**EXT. NEWGATE PRISON - NIGHT**

The night casts Newgate Prison in stark relief, its imposing walls standing as a silent testament to despair. JAMES, his appearance still that of a dandy, approaches the formidable gates with a measured stride, his inner turmoil masked by an air of outward confidence.

Upon reaching the gate, he is met by the GATEKEEPER, a man whose face bears the indifferent expression of one accustomed to the miseries contained within these walls.

JAMES  
(calmly, with a hint of authority)  
Good sir, I seek an audience with a lady named Moll within these walls. Can you assist me?

The GATEKEEPER, unmoved by pleas or titles, responds with the currency he understands best.

GATEKEEPER  
(eyeing James, bluntly)  
Aye, for a price. Two shillings.

JAMES, though inwardly chafing at the cost, recognizes the necessity of the payment. With a slight grimace, he reaches into his purse, retrieving the coins.

JAMES  
(resigned, yet determined)  
Very well. Lead the way.

Handing over the shillings, JAMES follows the GATEKEEPER through the prison's gates, each step taking him deeper into the bowels of Newgate. The air grows heavier, laden with the despair and filth that cling to the stone walls.

As they navigate through dimly lit corridors, the muffled sounds of misery and the pungent smell of human suffering assault JAMES's senses, a stark reminder of the stakes for which they fight. Despite the grim ambiance, his resolve only hardens, each step fueled by the urgency of MOLL's plight and the knowledge that every moment counts.

The GATEKEEPER leads him with an unchanging expression, indifferent to the sights and smells that have become his world. For JAMES, however, this journey is a stark voyage through humanity's darker recesses, a journey made bearable only by the light of his mission.

As they approach MOLL's cell, JAMES braces himself, not just for the sight of his comrade confined but for the confrontation of their shared reality. This mission is not just a rescue; it's a reaffirmation of their cause, a cause for which they are both willing to risk everything.

### Scene 25: Interior - Newgate Prison - Night

**INT. NEWGATE PRISON - NIGHT**

The corridors of Newgate Prison are a maze of despair, dimly lit and echoing with the remnants of hope that once resided within these walls. JAMES, guided by the indifferent JAILER, moves with purpose, his handkerchief a meager defense against the pervasive stench.

JAMES  
(firmly, to the Jailer)  
Ten minutes, remember.

The JAILER, with a sneer that speaks of his disdain for the prisoners and their visitors alike, locks JAMES inside MOLL's cell before departing, the heavy sound of the locking mechanism echoing ominously.

The cell, a small space illuminated by the faint light from a barred window, becomes the temporary world for JAMES and MOLL. Her expression, upon seeing JAMES, is one of relief and gratitude.

MOLL  
(softly, with sincerity)  
Thank you for coming, James.

JAMES, his resolve as strong as ever, wastes no time.

JAMES  
(determined)  
Anything for you, Moll. How do I get you out of here?

MOLL, her voice a whisper of urgency and desperation, lays out her plan.

MOLL  
(whispering)  
Go to my place. There’s a loose board under my bed, you’ll find money there, but I’m not completely sure how much. Fairfax demands two thousand, if you can find anything I’m short, I’ll repay you. Take the money to Fairfax and he'll release me. But be cautious, James. Don't let him deceive you.

JAMES  
(assuringly)  
I won't. I'll make sure you're free.

In the oppressive gloom of the cell, they share a moment of levity, a brief respite from the gravity of their situation. Their laughter, though fleeting, is a testament to their resilience, echoing off the cold stone walls.

JAMES  
(optimistically)  
I'll deliver the money, then return to my family. I won't be long.

MOLL  
(with heartfelt thanks)  
Thank you, James. Be careful.

Their goodbye is a quiet affair, marked by a mutual understanding of the risks ahead. As JAMES departs, he slips a coin to the JAILER, his gesture ensuring that, for one night at least, the other prisoners will receive a meal more decent than usual.

With MOLL's instructions echoing in his mind, JAMES sets off with a renewed determination. The promise of securing MOLL's freedom is a beacon in the darkness, guiding his every step as he ventures back into the night, ready to confront whatever challenges lie ahead in the name of friendship and loyalty.

### Scene 26: Exterior - Wooded Area - Day

**EXT. WOODED AREA - DAY**

JAMES, in a moment of tranquility, leans forward to soothe his horse, his touch gentle, his mind elsewhere. The weak sunlight, filtering through the dense canopy, plays upon the forest floor, casting a mosaic of light and shadow that dances with the sway of the branches.

Suddenly, the clatter of an approaching carriage cuts through his reverie, pulling him back to the present. His senses heighten, his instincts kick in. He spots a well-appointed coach winding its way along the rutted road below, accompanied by only a single driver.

**JAMES:**  
(under his breath)  
What's this?

With swift decision, JAMES readies himself, drawing his pistols with practiced ease. He urges his horse out onto the road, positioning himself squarely in the path of the approaching carriage.

**JAMES:**  
(directly, to the DRIVER)  
Are you armed, sir?

**DRIVER:**  
(shaking his head, a hint of nervousness in his voice)  
No, sir, I would be a danger to myself and my passengers if I were.

**JAMES:**  
(nodding, reassured)  
Very well, then. I mean you no harm. I only wish to speak to your passengers.

With a flourish, JAMES approaches the carriage, swinging open the door to reveal four startled young women. Their surprise is palpable, the air thick with tension and curiosity.

**JAMES:**  
(playing the part of the charmed rogue)  
What have we here? I was expecting to find a crotchety old man clutching a worn but full purse, but instead, I find myself bedazzled by a vision of outstanding beauty and grace, not just once, but four times. Driver, did you kill me, have I ascended to Heaven?

**DRIVER:**  
(bewildered)  
Why no sir, I told you, I have no weapon.

**JAMES:**  
(teasingly)  
This may be why you are charged with conveying such a fragrant cargo.

The carriage, sturdy and practical, holds no hidden dangers, only the giggling young women, their laughter a brief respite from the gravity of their situation. JAMES, his pistols now holstered, engages the ladies with a charm that belies his notorious reputation.

As the conversation unfolds, JAMES artfully weaves a tale of love and financial desperation, appealing to the women's sense of romance and compassion. The exchange is peppered with wit and laughter, but underpinning it all is JAMES's urgent need.

The moment of levity fades as JAMES presses his request, his charm giving way to the seriousness of his plight. The women, caught between sympathy and duty, weigh their response, their faces a mirror of internal conflict.

CONSTANCE, the most outspoken among them, reluctantly agrees to JAMES's demand, the weight of her decision heavy in her heart. JAMES, ever the gentleman rogue, assures them of his intent to repay, his gratitude genuine.

As JAMES takes his leave, the air is filled with a blend of admiration and worry. The encounter, though brief, leaves an indelible mark on the women, their journey forever altered by the charming Captain Hind.

JAMES disappears into the woods, the sound of his departure echoing softly. The women, left behind, share a moment of silent reflection, their journey ahead now uncertain, their hearts touched by an encounter that will become a tale of their own.

### Scene 27: Sir John's Study - Day

**INT. SIR JOHN'S STUDY - DAY**

The study, a testament to wealth and tradition, is dimly illuminated, its heavy drapes drawn. Antiques and rich furnishings speak of generations of affluence. SIR JOHN, an embodiment of distinguished heritage with his salt-and-pepper hair, sits behind his desk, a figure of authority and expectation.

The silence of the room is punctuated by a knock, a prelude to the unfolding drama.

**SIR JOHN:**  
(With a welcoming tone)  
Come.

The door creaks open to reveal HENRY, the sturdy steward, ushering in CONSTANCE, a vision of youth and beauty, her brown hair a cascade of natural elegance.

**SIR JOHN:**  
(Standing, his demeanor warm yet formal)  
Do come in, my dear.

Approaching CONSTANCE, Sir John performs the genteel act of kissing her hand, a gesture from a bygone era.

**SIR JOHN:**  
Your presence graces my humble home.

CONSTANCE, her glance sweeping the room, remains poised yet wary.

**CONSTANCE:**  
While your home is most gracious, sir, propriety demands we not be left alone.

**SIR JOHN:**  
Indeed. I shall summon my mother presently. She resides in the far wing and will join us soon.

Turning to HENRY with a discreet command,

**SIR JOHN:**  
Henry, inform the lady her presence is required.

With a nod, HENRY departs, leaving a palpable tension in the air.

**SIR JOHN:**  
Now, to business. I believe you have something for me?

CONSTANCE, her cheeks coloring, hesitates.

**CONSTANCE:**  
Surely, sir, our immediate concern should be our future together, not just the material.

Sir John, though patient, is insistent.

**SIR JOHN:**  
Priorities, my dear. We must adhere to the proprieties.

CONSTANCE, summoning her courage, broaches the subject delicately.

**CONSTANCE:**  
It concerns the dowry...

Taking a deep breath, she holds Sir John's gaze, her voice a mix of regret and defiance.

**CONSTANCE:**  
We were waylaid. The thief spared my virtue but took a thousand pounds.

Sir John's visage darkens, his expectations dashed.

**SIR JOHN:**  
Your purity, while commendable, does not fulfill our agreement.

CONSTANCE, her spirit undiminished, stands firm.

**CONSTANCE:**  
My father cannot provide more. Your demand was steep.

An interruption comes in the form of a discreet tap.

**SIR JOHN:**  
Enter.

HENRY returns, bearing news and confirmation of the shortfall.

**HENRY:**  
The money is accounted for, sir. Nearly a thousand pounds shy.

**SIR JOHN:**  
Secure it. We shall decide our next steps shortly.

Once alone again, Sir John delivers his ultimatum.

**SIR JOHN:**  
Without the full dowry, our arrangement cannot proceed. You must leave, and the remaining funds will compensate my troubles.

CONSTANCE, her hopes shattered, pleads for understanding.

**CONSTANCE:**  
Sir, is there no love in your heart for me?

SIR JOHN's response is cold, devoid of any pretense of affection.

**SIR JOHN:**  
Love? Your dowry and tale fail to inspire such sentiment. Return to your father. The money will stay as compensation for my inconvenience.

Watching CONSTANCE flee, a mix of triumph and disdain colors SIR JOHN's features. He settles back into his chair, the dealings of the heart and wealth neatly concluded in his favor.

### Scene 28

**INT. JAMES'S SAFE HOUSE - DAY**

The room is modest, lit by the soft glow of morning light that sneaks through a small window. It's here that JAMES prepares for his next role, a transformation necessitated by strategy rather than preference.

He pulls out a set of clothes from a wooden chest – ordinary, yet smart, befitting a man of modest means and serious demeanor. The garments are meticulously chosen: a nod to the austere, a disguise designed to blend in rather than stand out.

With deliberate care, JAMES dons a puritan hat, its broad brim shadowing his eyes, adding an air of devout mystery to his appearance. He pauses, studying his reflection in a small, slightly tarnished mirror propped against the wall.

He adjusts the hat, carefully tucking his hair up inside to ensure not a strand betrays his true identity. His transformation is almost complete, but one final touch remains.

JAMES scans the room, his eyes landing on a well-worn Bible resting atop a modest shelf. With a sense of purpose, he picks it up, feeling its weight, its significance not just as a prop but as a symbol.

Tucking the Bible under his arm, JAMES embodies the persona of a devout Puritan, a disguise that will allow him to move freely, unnoticed by those who might seek to stop him.

He takes one last look in the mirror, nodding to himself, the final acknowledgment of the role he is about to play. With a deep breath, he turns from his reflection and steps out into the daylight, leaving the safety of the hideaway behind.

The door closes softly behind him, and JAMES disappears into the bustling streets of London, a lone figure on a mission, his appearance a testament to the lengths he will go to for those he is sworn to protect.

### Scene 29

**EXT./INT. SIR THOMAS FAIRFAX'S LONDON RESIDENCE - DAY**

The London streets are alive with the hustle of daily life, but JAMES, or rather, 'Edward Willoughby,' cuts through the crowd like a shadow. His scowl is a shield, parting the sea of people before him. It's a quiet amusement for him, noting how quickly others avert their gaze or change their path to avoid his stern approach. The effect of his Puritan disguise is palpable, lending him an aura of unapproachable austerity.

Turning off the busy street, JAMES finds himself on a quieter lane, lined with elaborately decorated buildings that speak of wealth and influence. He strides with purpose, his destination clear. The residence of Sir Thomas Fairfax looms ahead, its facade imposing yet distinguished.

Without hesitation, JAMES climbs the steps to the front door, his hand rapping firmly against the wood. The door swings open, revealing a MANSERVANT, taken aback by the sudden appearance of this stern visitor.

**JAMES:**  
(With an authoritative tone)  
Edward Willoughby to see the General.

Without waiting for an invitation or acknowledgment, JAMES, still embodying the character of Edward Willoughby, steps past the threshold, his presence commanding and his scowl unwavering. The MANSERVANT, momentarily flustered by the abrupt entrance, hurries to close the door behind him, casting a wary glance at the visitor's retreating back.

Inside, the residence is a testament to Sir Thomas Fairfax's status, each room meticulously appointed and echoing the footsteps of history. JAMES moves with a confident stride, the heavy thud of his boots on the polished floors a stark contrast to the hushed reverence of the surroundings.

As he is led deeper into the heart of the house, the air seems to thicken, charged with the anticipation of the impending encounter. JAMES's disguise, a calculated choice, now serves its most crucial purpose: to bring him face-to-face with Sir Thomas Fairfax, a meeting that could change the course of events to come.

### Scene 30

**INT. SIR THOMAS FAIRFAX'S LONDON RESIDENCE - ENTRANCE HALL - DAY**

The entrance hall of Sir Thomas Fairfax's residence is a space of quiet grandeur, its walls echoing the footsteps of those who've traversed its floors throughout history. JAMES, still under the guise of 'Edward Willoughby,' stands amidst this splendor, his posture rigid, his expression unreadable beneath the stern facade.

The MANSERVANT, with a respectful nod, addresses him.

**MANSERVANT:**  
I will tell the general you are here, sir. Kindly wait here.

JAMES gives a curt nod, his eyes following the MANSERVANT as he disappears into a room off the entrance hall. The minute that follows is a tense silence, filled only with the soft ticking of a grand clock and the muffled sounds of the bustling city outside.

Shortly, the MANSERVANT reappears, gesturing for JAMES to follow. He's led into a room that speaks of power and deliberation, a place where decisions impacting the nation are made.

The room is richly appointed, yet it bears an air of utilitarian purpose. Bookshelves line the walls, filled with volumes of law and military strategy. A large desk dominates the space, papers neatly organized, each document a testament to the weighty responsibilities of Sir Thomas Fairfax.

As JAMES enters, he takes in his surroundings, his every sense alert. This is the heart of the lion's den, and he is acutely aware of the gravity of his mission. His scowl softens imperceptibly, replaced by a look of determination. He's here to play his part, and the stakes could not be higher.

### Scene 31

**INT. LORD FAIRFAX'S RESIDENCE - LIVING AREA - DAY**

The living area is bathed in the warm glow of a crackling fire, the flames casting dancing shadows across the room. LORD FAIRFAX, a figure of authority even in repose, is seated comfortably on a sofa before the hearth, a cup of tea in hand. The ambiance is one of quiet reflection, a stark contrast to the world outside.

As JAMES enters, LORD FAIRFAX looks up, his demeanor welcoming.

**LORD FAIRFAX:**  
Would you care to join me, sir?

**JAMES:**  
(With a polite nod)  
Thank you, tea would be most welcome at this time.

As JAMES takes a seat, the initial pleasantries give way to a moment of recognition, the familiarity of the visitor dawning upon LORD FAIRFAX. His surprise is evident, a rare break in his usually composed exterior.

**FAIRFAX:**  
(Startled, then recognizing)  
You?

JAMES allows himself a small grin, the irony of the situation not lost on him.

**JAMES:**  
(The same, sir. I am here to take advantage of the parole you offered to whoever delivers Moll’s ransom.

**FAIRFAX:**  
(I see. So, you have something for me?

**JAMES:**  
(Confidently)  
Indeed I do, sir. Moll asked me to deliver this to you here, in person.

FAIRFAX, intrigued, accepts the parcel from JAMES. With careful movements, he slices it open to reveal its contents—golden Jacobusses, their luster a testament to their value. He glances up at JAMES, a hint of curiosity in his gaze.

**FAIRFAX:**  
I bet you have never seen so much gold at any one time, eh?

**JAMES:**  
(With a wry smile)  
Certainly not often.

There's a pause, a silent understanding passing between the two men. FAIRFAX, momentarily lost in thought, returns his attention to the task at hand, the gold in front of him.

**FAIRFAX:**  
(Hm. Can you wait awhile as I count it?

**JAMES:**  
(Affirmatively)  
Of course, sir.

As FAIRFAX begins to count the gold, JAMES waits patiently, his mind no doubt racing with thoughts of Moll's freedom and the implications of this exchange. The room, with its flickering firelight and the soft sounds of gold being tallied, becomes a stage for a moment of critical importance, not just for Moll but for the intricate dance of power and principle in which they are all entwined.

### Scene 32

**INT. SIR THOMAS FAIRFAX'S RESIDENCE - STUDY - DAY**

The study, with its ambiance of solemn history and purpose, serves as the backdrop for the conclusion of a negotiation marked by tension and unexpected candor. LORD FAIRFAX, after a meticulous count, finds satisfaction in the completion of his task.

**FAIRFAX:**  
(With a nod of approval)  
It is all here. I shall honor my word.

He crosses the room with a sense of resolve, retrieving a sheet of writing paper from his desk. JAMES, watching intently, reads the note upside down as FAIRFAX pens it.

**FAIRFAX:**  
(As he writes, solemnly)  
My dear William. I have been persuaded to withdraw all charges against my assailant on Hounslow Heath, and therefore humbly request that you order the release of Miss Moll Cutpurse from Newgate prison forthwith. Your humble servant, Fairfax.

He looks directly at JAMES, a silent acknowledgment passing between them.

**FAIRFAX:**  
I have no need of this money; I mistakenly thought it would be beyond her reach. But I shall use it to assist the Army in its disputes with parliament over pay.

JAMES, seizing the moment for a deeper connection, ventures into more contentious territory.

**JAMES:**  
(Thoughtfully)  
I heard that you opposed the murder of our King.

**FAIRFAX:**  
(Somberly)  
I did, but my voice was not heard.

The conversation shifts to a reflection on past actions and the current political climate.

**JAMES:**  
(With conviction)  
Killing people is not the answer. You, sir, are a voice of reason in this troubled time.

**FAIRFAX:**  
(Acknowledging)  
An unusual approach, indeed. My influence is not what it once was.

The mention of THOMAS and the consequences of past actions brings a somber note to their exchange.

**JAMES:**  
(With a hint of sorrow)  
Our leader Thomas died because of such recklessness. I vow to make those responsible answer for their actions.

**FAIRFAX:**  
(Reflectively)  
I shall remember this discussion. Our paths may cross again, and when they do, I will keep today in mind.

With the conclusion of their business, FAIRFAX calls for his servant to ensure the delivery of the critical message.

**FAIRFAX:**  
(Loudly)  
Carstairs!

**CARSTAIRS** enters, attentive.

**FAIRFAX:**  
(Directly)  
Take this message to the Attorney General's office. Ensure it reaches William Steele, and await his response.

**CARSTAIRS:**  
(Understanding the gravity)  
Yes, sir.

With the arrangements made, FAIRFAX extends a hand to JAMES, a gesture of mutual respect despite their differing paths.

As JAMES is led from the room, the weight of their conversation lingers, a testament to the complexity of honor, duty, and the relentless pursuit of justice in tumultuous times.

### Scene 33

**INT. INN - DAY**

The inn is a cocoon of warmth and merriment, sheltered from the chill outside. ZACHARY HOWARD enters, his presence a stark contrast to the easy camaraderie filling the room. He pauses, surveying the scene, a predator calculating his approach.

The two elderly men by the door, lost in their world of smoke and spousal grievances, go unnoticed by ZACHARY, his focus sharpening on a solitary figure in the corner. With his target in sight, ZACHARY strides to the bar with a plan forming.

**ZACHARY:**  
(To the LANDLORD, with an air of casual intent)  
A tankard of ale and a bowl of pottage, please.

**LANDLORD:**  
(Tilting his head, offering a jug instead)  
Are you sure you wouldn't prefer a jug, sir? Most find our ale too good to stop at one.

**ZACHARY:**  
(With a laugh, playing the part of the dutiful husband)  
No, I must get home to Faringdon. My wife has little patience for drunken stumbles.

His jest earns a ripple of laughter from the inn's patrons, a brief connection in the solitary journey he's on.

**ZACHARY:**  
(Pointing to his chosen spot)  
I'll take a seat over there.

With ale and food in hand, ZACHARY moves through the room, each step calculated. He nods to his mark, THOMAS, as he takes his seat, a silent opener to the game he's about to play.

**THOMAS:**  
(With curious interest)  
Sir? You're headed to Faringdon?

ZACHARY turns, engaging eagerly.

**ZACHARY:**  
Indeed, sir. I'm a cheese-maker, returning from Wallingford. The market there favors my wares.

The conversation pauses as ZACHARY's food arrives, but soon resumes with renewed interest.

**ZACHARY:**  
(Probing gently)  
And you, sir? Your accent hints at London.

**THOMAS:**  
(Candidly)  
Yes, from London. Newly employed and on an errand for my master's wife.

**ZACHARY:**  
(Speculating)  
Sir Robert Pye?

**THOMAS:**  
(Shaking his head)  
No, Lord Fairfax. His wife resides there for now.

ZACHARY seizes upon the mention of FAIRFAX, a name that carries weight and history.

**ZACHARY:**  
Ah, Fairfax. His leadership was pivotal early on. Cromwell too, but Fairfax laid the groundwork.

**THOMAS:**  
(Agreeing)  
Indeed, his role was crucial.

The conversation deepens, formalities giving way to a tentative bond over shared respect for history and duty.

**THOMAS:**  
(Extending his hand)  
Thomas Edwards, at your service.

**ZACHARY:**  
(Returning the gesture)  
Zachary Roberts.

As they settle into their meal, an idea takes shape between them—a shared journey, a chance for company and protection on the road to Faringdon. ZACHARY, initially cautious, finds the prospect appealing.

**THOMAS:**  
(With genuine offer)  
Perhaps we could ride together? For safety, and perhaps for pleasant company.

**ZACHARY:**  
(After a moment's consideration, nodding)  
An intriguing thought. I've never feared the road, but company would indeed make the journey more bearable.

In this agreement, a journey begins—not just across the countryside but into an alliance formed from circumstance and mutual need, their paths now intertwined as they prepare to face whatever the road may bring.

### Scene 34

**EXT. GENTLE SLOPE OUTSIDE FARINGDON - DAY**

The landscape stretches before them, a serene tapestry silhouetted against the dying light of the setting sun. Two horses amble up the gentle slope, their riders, ZACHARY and THOMAS, silhouettes themselves against the vast canvas of the countryside. As they reach the summit, the town of Faringdon comes into view, a promise of rest and the end of their journey.

ZACHARY, ever watchful, scans the road behind them before focusing once more on the path ahead. A moment of contemplation precedes his confession.

**ZACHARY:**  
(With a tone of regret)  
I regret, sir, that I may have slightly misled you.

**THOMAS:**  
(Confused)  
Oh, how so?

ZACHARY's revelation comes not with a flourish but with a weight, a burden he has carried.

**ZACHARY:**  
My family name is not, in fact, Roberts. It is Howard. Perhaps you have heard of me?

THOMAS's response is tinged with incredulity, a lack of recognition that seems to wound ZACHARY more than any physical blow could.

**THOMAS:**  
(Questioningly)  
No. Should I have?

ZACHARY's pride, once masked, now surfaces with a hint of melancholy.

**ZACHARY:**  
I would have hoped so. But my name is indeed Zachary Howard, and I am, in fact, a highwayman of some repute.

The air between them shifts, the camaraderie of the road now replaced by the stark reality of ZACHARY's profession. His demand is clear, unequivocal.

**ZACHARY:**  
I only rob the accursed Roundheads, and as your master certainly qualifies, I would ask you to hand over your bags.

The ensuing silence is shattered by the sound of a pistol firing, a desperate act by THOMAS that marks the end of any pretense of fellowship. The shot, intended for ZACHARY, finds his horse instead, sending both into a chaotic tumble.

As ZACHARY rises, the situation spirals, his intentions laid bare, his resolve unflinching. The confrontation reaches its zenith, a tragic culmination of choices made and paths crossed.

**ZACHARY:**  
(With a cold finality)  
I shall either take the bags while you stand over by those trees, or alternatively, I can take them while you lie bleeding beside them.

THOMAS's refusal, a last stand against the inevitable, seals his fate. ZACHARY's response is swift, decisive, and final. The sound of the shot echoes, a grim punctuation to their encounter.

In the aftermath, ZACHARY's actions are methodical, a grim ritual of survival in a world governed by violence and greed. He secures the horse, searches the body, and drags THOMAS into the undergrowth, a final indignity for the man who dared to oppose him.

With the letter now in his possession, ZACHARY's gaze lingers on the body of his victim, a stark reminder of the costs of their chosen paths. The road ahead is clear, but the shadows of the deeds done this day will follow him, a silent testament to the darkness that lies within.

### Scene 35: Lady Fairfax's Encounter

**INT. LADY ANNE FAIRFAX'S RESIDENCE - DAY**

The room exudes an air of quiet elegance, bathed in the soft light filtering through long drapes. LADY ANNE FAIRFAX, a woman whose presence commands attention, looks up as ZACHARY enters. Her keen gaze, assessing and composed, rests upon him.

**LADY FAIRFAX:**  
I am told you wish to see me.

**ZACHARY:**  
Yes, milady. Lord Fairfax sent me with this letter for you.

The manservant beside ZACHARY steps forward, taking the letter and delivering it to LADY FAIRFAX, who carefully opens it and reads. ZACHARY's eyes wander the room, noting its lined bookshelves and the cozy sofa by the fire where a younger woman, silent and observant, sits. Another manservant's unwavering gaze meets ZACHARY's.

After a moment, LADY FAIRFAX's voice cuts the silence.

**LADY FAIRFAX:**  
Thomas, is that your name?

ZACHARY nods, a brief acknowledgment.

**LADY FAIRFAX:**  
This letter mentions you were carrying some plate. Where is it?

**ZACHARY:**  
In my saddlebags, your ladyship.

LADY FAIRFAX signals the manservant behind the sofa.

**LADY FAIRFAX:**  
Smithers, would you retrieve the bags?

Smithers casts a wary glance at ZACHARY before exiting. The door closes, leaving a tense silence. ZACHARY, seizing the moment, reveals his true intentions.

**ZACHARY:**  
I fear I've misled you, my lady. My name is not Thomas. My true purpose here isn't delivery, but rather... a different kind of business.

LADY FAIRFAX, quick to grasp the gravity of the situation, signals compliance to her daughter. Smithers reenters, the weight of the saddlebags evident. He pauses, taking in the scene before him.

**ZACHARY:**  
Ah, good, Smithers. Now, if you'd be so kind as to place the bags down there. Thank you.

With an efficiency born of necessity, ZACHARY directs the securing of the room's occupants, his demeanor leaving no room for doubt as to his seriousness.

**LADY FAIRFAX:**  
You do realize the consequences of this action?

ZACHARY, with a hint of defiance, replies.

**ZACHARY:**  
The world has made me what I am, Lady Fairfax. It's time I took my share.

With the room secured, ZACHARY turns his attention back to LADY FAIRFAX.

**ZACHARY:**  
Now, Lady Fairfax, let's proceed with our... collection. I trust you'll guide me to the valuables?

With a mixture of resignation and steely resolve, LADY FAIRFAX nods, leading ZACHARY from the room. The remaining occupants, bound yet unharmed, are left in an uneasy silence, the outcome of this encounter hanging in the balance.

### Scene 36: The Raid on the Cottage

**EXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAY**

The quiet of the village is disrupted as a contingent of soldiers, led by a CONSTABLE, a PURITAN, and an OFFICER, march with purpose down the street. A growing crowd of locals, drawn by the spectacle, trails behind them, whispering among themselves, their curiosity piqued.

The procession halts before a row of cottages, each one telling its own story of rural life. The CONSTABLE, with a knowing look, points to one cottage near the end of the row.

**CONSTABLE:**  
(With certainty)  
That be his.

The OFFICER, his gaze sharp and commanding, selects four soldiers for a strategic maneuver.

**OFFICER:**  
(Directing)  
You and you, go down this alley and make your way along the back, keeping yourselves well hidden. Take station the other side of the cottage.

As the first pair departs, he points to two more soldiers.

**OFFICER:**  
(Continuing)  
You and you, follow them and take station at the back.

The troops disperse quickly, their movements swift and silent. Once they vanish from sight, the OFFICER leads the remaining soldiers forward, the PURITAN hanging back, a silent observer of the unfolding drama.

**OFFICER:**  
(To the remaining soldiers)  
Jenkins, Hallett; go into this garden and take station this side of the cottage. Be ready in case the target bolts. Now, the rest of you follow me to the door. Let none escape.

The soldiers advance, their presence a stark contrast to the peaceful village surroundings. The natural sounds of the village fade into a tense silence, the anticipation palpable.

Approaching the cottage door, the officer signals to his men. With a coordinated effort, two soldiers shoulder the door open, stumbling slightly as it gives way more easily than expected.

The OFFICER, undeterred by the slight mishap, strides in after his men, his gaze fixed and unyielding.

Inside, the mundane sounds of domestic life—the chopping of vegetables, the humming of a tune—suddenly take on a new significance. The soldiers, now inside the cottage, find themselves in the heart of their mission, the outcome of which hangs in the balance as the villagers outside wait, breath held, for what comes next.

### Scene 37: The Search at Margaret's Cottage

**INT. COTTAGE - DAY**

The cottage is warmly lit by a low fire in the grate. MARGARET, standing in the kitchen area, faces the soldiers. Her expression is one of fear mixed with defiance, a large knife held uncertainly in her hand. The children, gathered around the fireplace, watch the scene unfold with wide, fearful eyes.

**OFFICER:**  
(With authoritative calm)  
Kindly place the knife on the table, madam. We wish to avoid accidents.

MARGARET, visibly terrified, lets the knife clatter to the floor and steps back.

**MARGARET:**  
(Anxiously)  
Who are you, and what do you want? We have nothing of value.

**OFFICER:**  
(With a stern demeanor)  
Madam, we are not thieves but servants of Parliament. It is your husband who is accused of theft.

He gestures to his men, indicating the puritan who now steps closer but remains in the doorway, observing.

**OFFICER:**  
(Firmly)  
Search the premises.

**MARGARET:**  
(Resolutely)  
If you seek my husband, he has not been here for weeks.

**OFFICER:**  
(With a hint of frustration)  
We are aware of his movements, yet we hoped he might have returned. Perhaps you could enlighten us as to his whereabouts.

**MARGARET:**  
(Defiantly)  
I know nothing of his location. He keeps his affairs from me for this very reason.

The PURITAN, LUNT, interjects, his tone implying a thinly veiled threat.

**LUNT:**  
(With cold logic)  
Your ignorance does not aid you, madam. For the sake of your children, I advise you to cooperate and reveal his hiding place.

**MARGARET:**  
(Firmly)  
I cannot tell you what I do not know.

LUNT's gaze shifts to the children, his voice softer yet laced with insinuation.

**LUNT:**  
(Looking at the children)  
Perhaps your young ones know something of their father's whereabouts. It would be wise to speak up.

The children retreat further, their silence a testament to their loyalty. ALICE, the eldest, finds her voice amidst the fear.

**ALICE:**  
(Bravely)  
We know nothing, sir. Father shares no details of his work with us.

LUNT nods, acknowledging her courage, then turns back to the OFFICER with a decisive command.

**LUNT:**  
(To the OFFICER)  
We shall take them for further questioning. The children as well.

**OFFICER:**  
(Reluctantly)  
But, Mr. Lunt, is this necessary? The children—

**LUNT:**  
(Interrupting, with finality)  
It is required. Proceed as instructed.

The OFFICER, though reluctant, acquiesces to LUNT's orders, his duty clear.

**OFFICER:**  
(Gently, to MARGARET)  
Madam, please forgive us, but we must follow our orders.

As the soldiers begin to escort the family out, the tension in the room is palpable, a poignant reminder of the personal toll extracted by wider conflicts.
