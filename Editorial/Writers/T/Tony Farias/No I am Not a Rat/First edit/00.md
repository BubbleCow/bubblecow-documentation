# Prologue

The dawn chorus was already in full swing as Tony Sicily was gently roused from sleep, not by the shrill of his alarm but by the lively serenade of birds gathered in his meticulously cultivated backyard. This sanctuary, a labor of love, boasted an assembly of woodpeckers tapping rhythmically against the palm trees, the melodious call of cardinals and bluejays, and even the vibrant chatter of miniature parrots, creating a symphony that celebrated the new day.

Tony's ventures, particularly his lucrative dealings with Rocco in the Marlboro Cigarettes market, had borne fruit, affording him the luxury of this peaceful retreat. At fifty-five, his disciplined commitment to fitness allowed him to defy the years, his physique more akin to a man in his forties, a fact that didn't escape Rocco's envious remarks.

Beside him, Angelina, his wife, lay in peaceful slumber, the chaos of colorful pillows around her only adding to her allure. The morning light caressed her exposed skin, highlighting her Mediterranean beauty, her long black hair framing a face that carried the grace of her ballet years.

Emerging from the shower, the aroma of his bath gel lingering, Tony dressed in a manner that straddled casual and refinedâ€”a fresh pair of boxer shorts followed by linen shorts, a crisp polo shirt, and his favored brown Sperry top-siders. Running his fingers through his hair and finishing with a splash of cologne, he was ready to face the day.

"Angelina, are you up?" he called gently.

Her eyes fluttered open. "Yes, what's your plan?"

"I've got an early meeting with Rocco. Thought I'd grab coffee at Versailles first," Tony replied, his voice carrying a hint of the day's urgency.

"What time is it?" she inquired, a trace of sleep still in her voice.

"Almost eight."

Her response was immediate, a flurry of motion as she prepared for her Zumba class, leaving a promise of "tonight" hanging in the air, a tender note amidst the morning's rush.

The day's tranquility was shattered as Tony neared the garage, the sudden, insistent barking of their young puppy cutting through the morning calm like a warning siren. Peering through the window, Tony's gaze fell upon a tableau that seemed ripped from the pages of a tense thriller. Several sleek black cars had commandeered his driveway, their imposing forms casting long shadows in the early light. Surrounding his home was a cadre of ATF agents, their figures clad in the unmistakable bulk of bullet-proof vests, creating an intimidating barrier. In their hands, weapons were held with a professionalism that spoke of readiness and purpose, their stances alert and focused. This unexpected assembly of force, encircling his sanctuary with a palpable intensity, signaled a dramatic pivot in the day's unfolding narrative.

The tranquility of the morning shattered, Tony confronted the agents through the intercom, his voice a mix of incredulity and assertiveness. "What's happening?"

"We're here for Tony Sicily. There's a warrant for your arrest," came the stern reply, the seriousness of the situation dawning on Tony as the agent mentioned charges from a federal grand jury.

Angelina, suddenly jolted from the remnants of her slumber, emerged into the chaos, her figure enshrouded in a plush white robe that contrasted starkly with the severity of the scene before her. Her eyes, wide with a mix of fear and disbelief, scanned the unfolding situation as Tony was restrained with handcuffs, his freedom abruptly curtailed. The vulnerability in her posture, her hands clutching the fabric of her robe as if seeking comfort, painted a poignant picture of her alarm. Her scream, a visceral response to the sight of her husband in custody, tore through the morning air, a stark and jarring contrast to the serene beginning of their day. This outcry reverberated against the stoic, unyielding faces of the agents, their expressions etched with the cold determination of duty, unaffected by the emotional turmoil they had instigated.

"Tony, what's going on?" she demanded, her fear for him evident in her eyes.

An agent, his weapon ominously pointed, reassured her with a cold professionalism that belied the charged atmosphere. Tony, protective even in his vulnerability, positioned himself between the danger and his wife, his defiance clear.

As the agents led Tony away, the promises of the day unraveled, leaving Angelina alone with her fear and the looming shadow of uncertainty. The ATF's arrival not only disrupted the serenity of their sanctuary but also signaled the beginning of a tumultuous chapter in their lives, one filled with legal battles and the harsh realities of facing federal charges.
