# Chapter 1
Lukas Dante's story begins in the picturesque fishing village of Pachino, Sicily, where the Mediterranean Sea whispers tales of yore to those who listen. Born to Angelini Dante and Michaela Fabrici, Lukas was the singular legacy of a family intertwined with the sea's rhythm. Angelini, alongside his brother Marcello, commanded a formidable fishing vessel, a behemoth that danced with the waves under the moon's gaze. This vessel wasn't just a means of livelihood; it was a vessel of adventure, charting courses along the enchanting Sicilian coast, from Syracuse to the mystical islands of Malta, Sardinia, and Corsica, and the historic ports of Ragusa, Pantelleria, Agrigento, Palermo, and Messina. Their nights at sea harvested the ocean's bounty—prawns, anchovies, grouper, local sea bass, sardines, octopus, clams, and the elusive calamari—which they would peddle at dawn in the next port, a testament to their nocturnal labors.

Their journey wasn't solely about the catch. On serendipitous occasions, they'd stumble upon treasures of cigarettes, liquors, wines, and other culinary delights, turning their vessel into a floating bazaar that brought exotic tastes to each port.

At eight, Lukas was a striking figure among his peers, his height, blonde hair, and green eyes a beacon of youthful vigor. His allure wasn't just skin deep; it was said he inherited the charm and grace of his mother, Michaela, a woman of stunning beauty with roots stretching back to Catalonia, Spain.

Angelini, a figure carved from the sea itself, stood tall and lean, with jet-black hair and eyes that mirrored the depths he sailed. His hands, etched with the tales of the sea, and his arms, strong from wrestling with the waves, spoke volumes of his life's dedication.

The narrative then shifts to a young Tony Sicily, a mere twelve years old, perched on the steps of his family home in 1962, amidst the transformative tide of La Revolucion. His observant eyes took in the flurry of village life as it converged on the plaza for the fiesta honoring the Virgin of Candelaria. It was a snapshot of time, capturing the essence of community and tradition in the face of change.

Enter Maria, Tony’s cousin from Miami, a bridge to a world beyond the confines of Sicily. Having carved out a life in Miami on the strength of a worker's contract, Maria brought with her whispers of a different existence, encapsulated in the simple act of sharing a pack of Viceroy American cigarettes with Tony. Her presence, a blend of the familiar and the exotic, offered Tony a glimpse into a realm of possibilities, far removed from the revolution's shadows.

“May I have one?” Tony asked.

“Tony, if your father’s bus drives by and Alcides sees you smoking, you are going to get in trouble,” she said.

“It’s okay; he knows I smoke. I’ve been smoking American cigarettes since I was eight. I’m twelve now, and I work in the warehouse,” he said. “I want to go to Miami. I don’t like La Revolucion. We cannot get ham, bread, or American cigarettes.”

“What warehouse are you working at?” she asked. “You are just a kid.”

“Sabatez, unloading trucks of detergents.”

“You are not playing baseball anymore?”

“All the time. I go to Cascorro’s poor neighborhood and play con los Negros,” Tony said.
