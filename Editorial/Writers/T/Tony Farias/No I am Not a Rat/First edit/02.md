# Chapter 2
As Tony Sicily found himself seated on a flight bound for Miami, his mind was awash with the parting words of his parents at the Havana airport. Confusion lingered in his thoughts—why the need to seek out someone named George upon arrival, connected somehow to a figure named Pedro Pam and a mysterious camp in Miami? The possibility of staying with his cousin instead seemed far simpler, yet unexplored.

Clad in a sweater lovingly crafted by his mother, Tony adjusted his Panama hat, a gesture that spoke of his attempt to find comfort in the unfamiliar. Seeking a semblance of normalcy, he requested a cold Coca-Cola from the steward, just as the captain's voice filled the cabin, announcing their imminent arrival in Miami.

Upon touchdown, Tony hesitantly made his way to the exit, each step heavy with the weight of uncertainty about what awaited him in this new city. Navigating through Customs, he found himself repeating the same question to passersby, "Are you George?" This search culminated when a man, whose appearance—mid-forties, of medium stature, with brown hair—seemed to fit the vague description Tony had been given, approached him with a simple inquiry, "Estas solo?"

Confirming his solitude, Tony was led to join a group of children, each carrying their own stories of journeys undertaken, gathered beside a van where an elderly man awaited. This man, introduced as Brother Pedro, signified the next phase of Tony's journey as they departed for the camp, leaving behind the familiarity of the airport for the unknown.

The camp itself was a collection of modest one-story structures, its ordinariness belied by the presence of a basketball court and a baseball field, symbols of normalcy and perhaps, hope. Brother Pedro's welcoming words, promising milk and sandwiches, offered a brief respite to the children, a momentary pause in their shared narrative of displacement.

However, it was the sight of a cigarette vending machine in the reception area that unexpectedly brought a smile to Tony's face. Amidst the upheaval and the unfamiliar, this small token of familiarity whispered to him that perhaps, just perhaps, this new place might hold its own charms and possibilities.
