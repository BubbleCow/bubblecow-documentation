The camp's daily schedule was a whirlwind of activity. Mornings were dedicated to academics under the tutelage of the Marist Brothers, who brought a piece of Havana with them through their educational ethos. Afternoons were a stark contrast, filled with the camaraderie and competition of sports, as the boys divided their time between the basketball court and the baseball diamond.

Tony, with his agility and keen sense of the game, successfully tried out for the under-thirteen basketball team. His prowess was particularly evident during a game that pitted them against a team from the city, where Tony's performance caught everyone's eye.

Weekend excursions to Miami Beach provided a welcome respite from the structured days at camp. These outings, orchestrated by the Marist Brothers, offered the boys a taste of freedom and leisure as they enjoyed the ocean and shared picnics on the sand. It was during one such weekend that Tony's life took a memorable turn.

While meandering along the beach, he noticed a girl in the water near the shore, her presence radiating with a kind of effortless allure. She beckoned Tony to join her, her voice carrying over the waves. Standing nearly as tall as him, her blonde hair and striking blue eyes stood out against the backdrop of the sea, her figure accentuated by her swimwear.

Introducing themselves in the brief interlude that followed, Tony found himself drawn into an unexpected moment of intimacy. "I'm Tony," he said, met with a smile and the introduction, "Virginia," as she ventured closer. The ensuing interaction, marked by Virginia's bold curiosity, ushered Tony into a whirlwind of new sensations and feelings, setting the stage for an unforgettable chapter in his life.

She lowered her bikini and straddled him until they joined together. “Oh, Tony, you feel so big.” In that moment, Tony knew that he was going to be addicted to that feeling forever.
