"Hey, Rob. Caught your call just as I was wrapping up another. What's the situation?" Tony inquired.

"Morning, Tony. We've just wrapped a discussion with a duo from Miami, Rocco and Rosario. They're pitching us to distribute Maxxon, a brand out of Paraguay," Rob shared.

"And who exactly are these guys?" Tony probed.

"Rocco and Rosario," Rob repeated. "They've secured a $100,000 deposit from Mark for 10,000 master cases, each with sixty cartons, and now they're looking for us to transfer the remaining $4.5 million."

Tony quickly ran the numbers. "That's 600,000 cartons, hitting us at $7.50 each. We're talking a markup of over a dollar per carton from the usual rate. Has Mark lost his senses?"

"Look, Tony, at a competitive price, we can offload these cigarettes, truck by truck. But fronting the cash? That's not happening. Ever heard of these fellows?" Rob asked.

"They're news to me. I'll dig around."

"We've directed them your way, mentioning you're our go-to guy in Miami for purchases. So, you're on point to negotiate a fair price, and we'll forward payment per truckload as needed," Rob outlined.

"Did they leave a contact?" Tony asked.

"No, I've passed your details instead. I'd rather not get involved," Rob admitted.

"Alright, I'll take it from here," Tony assured.

After a brief pause, Tony reached out to Alfredo.

"Alfredo, ever come across importers named Rocco and Rosario?" Tony queried.

A moment of silence lingered before Alfredo's voice broke through, "Yes, I'm familiar. What's up?"

"They've approached a client in Ohio with their Maxxon cigarettes from Paraguay, telling them I'm the broker here. What's your take?"

Alfredo's advice was clear, "Tony, tread carefully. Rocco and Rosario are bad news. Never send money upfront. You hitting the gym later?"

"Not tonight. Got a late meeting, then dinner plans with Angelina," Tony replied, mentally noting Alfredo's warning about the duo.
