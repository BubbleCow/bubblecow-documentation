On a radiant Friday afternoon in January, Miami boasted a perfect seventy-two degrees, the sky a canvas of unbroken blue. Tony, seizing the day, rang up Caffe Abbracci, a cherished Italian bistro nestled within the heart of Coral Gables, securing a table for two at 8 p.m.

"Angelina, we're set for dinner at Caffe Abbracci, eight sharp," Tony informed her. "I've got business at Port Everglades, but I'll head straight there afterward."

"Just make sure you're on time. You know how it is—sitting solo at the bar makes me a magnet for unwanted attention," Angelina playfully warned.

"Should that happen, just let Benedetto know. He'll look out for you; he's a pal," Tony reassured her.

Upon arriving at Port Everglades, Tony smoothly passed through the security checkpoint and made his way to John Baldovino's warehouse. Ascending the steps to the office, he rapped on the door, greeted by John's robust welcome. The office, a testament to times past, housed two aged wooden desks, a rotary phone next to a computer monitor, and a metal cabinet, its surface etched with rust.

"Good evening, John. How's life treating you?" Tony greeted in Italian.

"All good, thanks. And yourself?" John responded.

"Not too bad, thanks. Managed to offload all your premium stock before the deadline?" Tony inquired.

"Absolutely. Cleared out everything. Now, I'm eyeing a venture into manufacturing in Paraguay—aiming at the value brand market," John disclosed.

"Speaking of Paraguay, heard of Rocco and Rosario? They're pushing a brand there," Tony probed.

"Yeah, I've crossed paths with them. Even discussed launching my own brand. What's your interest?" John inquired.

"They approached a client of mine in Ohio. Looks like I'm brokering their deal. Got any insights on their credibility?" Tony pressed.

"Steer clear. Those two are nothing but trouble. I wouldn't send a dime ahead," John cautioned.

"Got any more details on them? Names, company?" Tony sought further.

"Rogelio 'Rocco' Vacca and Rosario Eacobacci. Run something called Gulfstream, if memory serves," John provided.

"Thanks, John. Let me know when you're ready to market your value brand. I've got a network ready," Tony offered.

"Will do. Take care, and thanks," John concluded.

As Tony drove towards Coral Gables, his mind lingered on John's words. 'A pair of rats,' was it? This bit of intel painted a clear picture: dealing with Rocco and Rosario demanded caution.
