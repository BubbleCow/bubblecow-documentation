Tony's morning routine was interrupted by a call.

"Tony, Rocco here. Rob passed along your contact. We need to discuss business."

"Morning, Rocco. Sure, my office could work. It's in the same complex as Alfredo's place," Tony offered.

Rocco, pausing, decided on a different venue. "How about Houston's in Coral Gables for lunch?"

"1 p.m. works for me," Tony agreed, a hint of caution in his voice. He wondered about Rocco's reluctance to meet near Alfredo's, a thought that lingered as he prepared for the day.

Houston's, known for its bustling atmosphere and discreet seating, was an ideal spot for such a meeting. Tony, arriving early, settled at the bar with a drink, scanning the entrance for Rocco and his companion.

When two men matching Alfredo's description entered, Tony greeted them. Their initial exchange was brief before a hostess led them to a more private setting.

Rocco broached the subject of their brand Maxxon, mentioning the significant financial exchange they expected from Rob and Mark for the distribution rights in Ohio and Northern Indiana.

Tony outlined the conditions: the funds would come through him for product verification before any transaction was finalized, and the asking price needed adjustment.

Rocco bristled at the terms, visibly agitated by Tony's stance. However, Rosario's calming gesture eased the tension.

"Monday at 10, then. We'll review the stock in the Free Zone," Tony proposed, organizing the specifics of their agreement.

As they parted ways, Rocco's dissatisfaction was palpable, his parting words to Rosario revealing a veiled threat towards Tonyâ€”a reminder of the precarious nature of their dealings.
