# Chapter 9
Rocco and Rosario were busy overseeing the handling of a large consignment of premium, unstamped cigarettes in a nondescript warehouse. Their scheme involved bypassing Florida's state stamp requirement to funnel the would-be tax proceeds into their own accounts, a lucrative but illegal operation that had been running smoothly for over a year.

In the midst of orchestrating the movement of crates, with Billy maneuvering the forklift under Rocco's direction, the operation came to an abrupt halt. A fleet of unmarked vehicles skidded to a stop outside, and a mix of uniformed and plainclothes officers surged towards the warehouse entrance. As they stormed the loading dock, their commands echoed through the air, "Freeze! Hands where we can see them! You're under arrest!"

Rocco, caught off guard, demanded, "What's the meaning of this? Is there a warrant?"

A detective, brandishing the necessary paperwork, confirmed, "Yes, we have a warrant."

"And who exactly are you representing?" Rocco pressed.

"The ATF, state division," the detective replied, without missing a beat.

Rosario, seeking clarity amidst the chaos, inquired, "What are the charges?"

"You're facing multiple felony charges, including the illegal possession of unstamped cigarettes," was the stern reply.

Rocco's request to make a phone call was swiftly denied, with the detective informing him, "You'll get your call after we process you. Let's move out."

The swift intervention marked the beginning of a significant crackdown, as Rocco and Rosario found themselves ensnared in the legal consequences of their clandestine activities.
