# Chapter 11
Tony swiftly arranged his essentials into his carry-on and set off to Miami International Airport in his BMW, Las Vegas bound for the International Tobacco Trade Show. Before boarding, he made a quick call to Angelina.

"Angelina, I'm en route to the trade show in Vegas. I'll be at the Las Vegas Hilton," he informed her.

"Just keep me posted, love," she responded.

Thanks to a timely upgrade, Tony enjoyed the luxuries of first class during his flight, indulging in some scotch and rest.

Upon arrival and while navigating towards the taxi queue, his phone buzzed with a call from Mark. "Hey, Tony, you've touched down in Vegas?"

"Yeah, just got here. How about you?" Tony replied.

"I'm over at the Mandalay Bay. You?"

"The Hilton for me. Is Rob with you?"

"No, he's back in Florida," Mark answered.

"Alright, I'm off to catch some sleep. We'll catch up later," Tony said, planning a brief respite.

*************************

Post-check-in, Tony's first stop was a refreshing shower, followed by a brief moment of relaxation in the hotel's king-size bed, a luxury interrupted by another call.

"Tony, it's Rocco. You meeting with Mark in Vegas?"

"Yeah, planning on it. What's it about?"

"Those Marlboros, think Mark's interested?"

"Doubtful. His folks deal directly for Marlboros."

"And the tribes?"

"I'll see."

The following day, badge in hand for the trade show, Tony couldn't help but notice the array of stunning individuals heading towards the convention center.

Navigating the event, Tony admired the variety of representatives at each booth, his attention eventually captured by a particularly striking woman of medium build, her dark brown hair and green eyes accentuated by her mixed heritage. Approaching her, Tony complimented, "Morning, you're easily the highlight of the show."

"Thanks, that's sweet of you," she replied, scanning his badge. "And where might you be from with such charm?"

"Jamaican, actually. And you? Italian roots?"

"Cuban-born, but Italian blood runs through me. How about we grab a drink after this wraps up?"

She pondered, then offered, "I'm free after five."
