# Chapter 12
Tony was hunched over his desk, meticulously reviewing documents. The downturn in business was palpable, exacerbated by the delisting of several brands he distributed due to non-compliance with the master settlement agreement. In an effort to stir up some activity, he reached out to his contacts in upstate New York.

"Karina, hope you're well. How's everything at the reservation?" Tony initiated.

"Doing okay, Tony. And yourself?"

"It's been tough; sales are down. Is there anything specific you're looking for that I might help with?"

"Actually, I've been struggling to source premium brands. Any chance you can assist?" Karina inquired.

"I'll see what's available here. How would we handle shipping?"

Karina promised to send over the details of Piedmont Freight, a carrier she trusted for her shipments to Salamanca, sparking a plan in Tony's mind.

This conversation brought Tony back to the time he first met Karina through a friend from Ohio. Their immediate connection had blossomed into a strong friendship, with Karina now spearheading a significant distribution operation on the Salamanca reservation.

Meanwhile, at Rocco's residence in Coral Gables, a strategy session was underway with Rocco, Renato, and Rosario.

"Rocco, it's crucial Tony buys into this Marlboro scheme, thinking they're illicit. It's a key condition of your deal with the DA for your cooperation with the ATF," Renato emphasized.

Rocco, understanding the gravity, dialed Tony again. "Tony, we've got a new product line we'd like you to manage. Meet us at our warehouse tomorrow at 10."

"Sure, send me the details," Tony agreed.

The next day, as the ATF prepared their surveillance outside the warehouse, a notable arrival in a large SUV was identified by the agents as CIA, soon followed by Tony.

Inside, the warehouse was a facade of legitimacy, with employees busily engaged at their desks.

"I'm here for Rocco," Tony announced upon entry.

Directed towards the warehouse's depths, Tony was met by Rocco and introduced to Roberto, the operator of the facility, and Renato, who was eager to showcase their Marlboro products.

"Let's take a look at these," Renato suggested, presenting two cases of Marlboros for Tony's inspection.

"They seem like genuine domestic Marlboros," Tony observed.

"That's because they are, straight out of Virginia," Renato claimed, proposing a deal for the cases at a significantly reduced rate.

Tony, cautious, declined immediate possession. "I can't store these. Do you have more, perhaps a few hundred cases?"

Affirmative, Renato confirmed availability, prompting Tony to request a detailed inventory breakdown for a potential buyer in New York.
