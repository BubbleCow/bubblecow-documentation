Having swapped contact details with Renato, Tony departed from the warehouse, his mind racing with the potential of this new venture not only as a lucrative opportunity for himself but also as a means to assist Karina.

By the following day, after receiving the specifics from Renato, it was decided that Tony would settle the transaction with a cashier’s check.

Dialing Karina, Tony relayed the good news. "Karina, I've managed to secure 192 cases of Marlboros, priced at nineteen dollars per carton. Interested?"

Without hesitation, Karina affirmed, "Absolutely. I'll get Valerio on it."

"Remember, I'll need the payment upfront," Tony reminded her.

Karina assured him that the financials would be handled promptly via a wire transfer upon receiving his invoice.

Connecting with Valerio next, Tony laid out the logistics. "Valerio, Karina mentioned you'd handle the pickup here in Miami for her. Can you manage Thursday?"

"Thursday works. Send over the details, and we'll ensure the funds are wired to you in advance," Valerio confirmed.

With the financials securely in place, Tony proceeded to the warehouse on Thursday, cashier’s check in hand, ready to finalize the purchase of the Marlboros.

Upon the truck's arrival, Tony was introduced to Pepe, Renato's partner, and promptly facilitated the unloading and inspection of the Marlboros, ensuring the product matched the agreed terms.

With everything in order, Tony completed the transaction, expressing his interest in future deals to Rocco and Renato.

***********

After Tony's departure, Rocco, Renato, and Pepe huddled to contemplate their next steps.

Rocco, seeing the smooth execution of their plan, couldn't hide his satisfaction. "This sets us up perfectly," he remarked.

Pepe then outlined his role moving forward, especially with Renato's relocation to New York, emphasizing the need to maintain the illusion of the Marlboros' questionable origin to Tony, ensuring plausible deniability should any suspicions arise.

As they wrapped up, the consensus was to lay low, giving Tony the impression of the Marlboros' dubious legality, thereby securing their operation's secrecy for the foreseeable future.
