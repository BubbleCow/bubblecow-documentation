After numerous attempts to reach Renato only led to his voicemail, Tony couldn't help but ponder the worst. Given the precarious nature of their business, any outcome seemed plausible. Concerned, he reached out to Rocco for any leads.

"Rocco, it's Tony. Any word on Renato's whereabouts?"

"He might've headed to the Dominican Republic. Why not try Pepe? Here's his contact," Rocco suggested, providing Pepe's number.

Upon calling Pepe and encountering yet another voicemail, Tony left a message, hoping for a callback.

During a quiet dinner with Angelina, Tony shared his concerns about the slowing pace of his business and his plans to attend the upcoming trade show in Myrtle Beach, seeking new opportunities.

At the trade show, amidst the hustle of attendees, Tony's spirits lifted when he crossed paths with Karina. Distinguished and poised in her white shirt and black trousers, her presence brightened the event. Recognizing Tony, she greeted him with a warm smile.

"Tony, great to see you. How's business?"

"It's challenging. I'm here scouting for anything promising," Tony replied, his tone reflecting the struggle.

Karina, ever the opportunist, inquired, "Any luck finding more premium brands?"

"I'm on it. You'll be the first I call when I find something," Tony assured her, ever committed to fulfilling her needs.

Karina, seizing the moment, added, "While you're at it, I could use some Rodgerâ€™s. Think you can handle that?"

"Absolutely. Just shoot me the details," Tony responded, ready to meet her demands.
