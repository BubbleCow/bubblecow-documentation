As the new year dawned, Tony found himself navigating through the early days of 2008 when Rocco's call came through, hinting at a new opportunity with Pepe and some Marlboros on the line.

"Should I reach out to Pepe then?" Tony queried, sensing the urgency in Rocco's voice.

"Yeah, he's expecting your call," Rocco replied, a hint of mischief in his tone.

Without delay, Tony dialed Pepe, unaware of the surveillance net tightening around their conversation. "Pepe, Tony here. What's the situation?"

"Tony, I've got a hefty load this time—over 400 cases, and let's just say they're extremely urgent," Pepe informed him.

Tony, treading carefully, asked, "And where might these be coming from? You're not lifting them, I hope?"

Pepe's reply was cryptic yet ominous, "Better if you don't delve into that. Expect a breakdown by text, and we're looking at pick-up for next Tuesday."

"Understood. I'll coordinate the logistics," Tony assured.

Once Tony received the specifics from Pepe, he promptly got in touch with Valerio to set the wheels in motion.

"Valerio, there's a haul coming in—450 master cases of Marlboros. I've allocated 250 for Karina and 200 for your side. They're set for Tuesday morning pick-up. I'll ensure the invoices are sent to Zulema. We'll need the finances sorted by Monday," Tony detailed the plan.

"Much appreciated, Tony," came Valerio's grateful response.
