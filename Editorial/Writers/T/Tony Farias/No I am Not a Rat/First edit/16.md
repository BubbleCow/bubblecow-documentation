# Chapter 16
Months had passed since their last transaction, and now, Rocco and Pepe were gearing up for another deal, this time planning to introduce Valerio directly to them for future transactions. The strategy was simple: Pepe would entice Tony with an offer of 600 cases of Marlboros, and during the pick-up, they would ensure their contact information was handed off to the driver for Valerio.

Pepe wasted no time in reaching out to Tony, pitching the new batch of 600 cases at nineteen dollars per carton. Tony, seeing an opportunity, coordinated with Valerio for the pick-up and financials, marking up his profit margin in the process.



Tony's arrival at the warehouse was greeted by Roberto, who directed him towards the action at the back where Pepe and Rocco were overseeing the operation.

Rocco, spotting Tony, called out, “Glad you could make it, Tony. Just let the driver know we're almost set here.”

“Alright, but I'll need to tally the cases first,” Tony replied, eyeing the busy scene.

Pepe chimed in with the specifics, “We've got 430 reds and 170 whites ready to go.”

As the piedmont driver pulled in and Tony began overseeing the load-in, Rocco took a moment to discreetly pass the driver a note with their numbers for Valerio, suggesting he get in touch directly next time.

With the transaction completed and the truck fully loaded, Tony handed over the agreed payment to Pepe, who hinted at future dealings, “We’ll be in touch when the next batch is ready.”
