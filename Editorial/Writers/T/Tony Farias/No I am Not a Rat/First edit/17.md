# Chapter 17
Following his arrest, Tony found himself in an interrogation room in Doral, facing the possibility of becoming a confidential informant. His refusal was adamant, demanding legal representation for any further discussions.

The tension in the room shifted when Pepe, previously disguised in a ski mask, revealed his identity. 

"Tony, it's me, Pepe, from the Marlboro case. I was undercover," Pepe disclosed, attempting to jog Tony's memory.

Tony, however, denied any recognition. "I've never seen you before in my life," he countered, distancing himself from any connections to Pepe or the mentioned individuals.

Subsequently, Tony was processed at the federal detention center, where the reality of Rocco and Rosario's betrayal sank in, lamenting his misplaced trust in them.

As time passed slowly in detention, Tony remained isolated, rebuffing attempts at conversation from fellow inmates. Finally, in the late afternoon, he was escorted to his arraignment, where he pleaded not guilty to the charges presented against him. Bail was set, and soon after posting it, Tony reunited with Angelina and his lawyer, Fat Marcus.

"Meet me at my office tomorrow, Tony. We need to strategize," Fat Marcus advised, already planning to engage with the prosecutor for insights into their case.

The next day at Marcus's office, Tony was greeted by the imposing figure of his attorney, who shared that the prosecutor had a substantial amount of evidence, including voice recordings and video surveillance involving Tony and undercover operatives.

Realizing the depth of his predicament, Tony identified Rocco and Rosario as the likely informants, a revelation that prompted Marcus to consider all connections that might shed light on the case.

Concerned about legal fees, Tony broached the subject, to which Marcus outlined the cost of his defense. Tony committed to meeting the financial requirements, eager for any advantage they could leverage in his defense.
