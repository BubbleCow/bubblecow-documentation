# Chapter 18
In Fat Marcus's office, Tony handed over a $25,000 check with a promise, "I'll have the rest for you before we go to court."

Marcus updated him on his findings. "I had a word with Rocco's wife. She's out of the loop on this case, though she mentioned Rocco's legal tangles back in '04."

"It was Rocco and Rosario who looped me into this mess," Tony reflected.

"I've asked for every piece of evidence the DA's gotâ€”indictments, recordings, you name it," Marcus continued.

"We need to dig into Rocco, Rosario, and those ATF agents. Where's all that kickback money?" Tony pressed.

"An investigation on them will run us another $10,000," Marcus cautioned.

With little hesitation, Tony agreed, revealing, "I've got evidence of the pay-offs I made to Rocco."

Then came the matter of Valerio, Tony's co-defendant, who was staring down a lengthy sentence. "His lawyer suggests he might turn on you in court," Marcus warned.

"Valerio? I went out of my way for that guy," Tony lamented, betrayed by yet another supposed ally.
