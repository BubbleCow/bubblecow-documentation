# Chapter 20
In a crucial meeting within Marcus's office, Tony was briefed by Fat Marcus and Nayib on significant developments regarding Rocco, Rosario, and questionable ATF operations. Nayib, having unearthed substantial dirt on Tony's adversaries and a damning audit of the ATF, laid out the findings.

Tony, eager for vindication, questioned the strategic use of this information, particularly concerning the cashier's check he'd handed over to Rocco. Nayib revealed its deposit into a Key Biscayne bank account under a company controlled by Rosario, unraveling Rocco's past as a busted felon turned ATF informant through a plea deal.

The conversation then shifted to the ATF audit, exposing a staggering mishandling of millions of cartons of cigarettes and misappropriated funds over several years.

"Can we leverage any of these revelations during the trial?" Tony pressed, seeking avenues to bolster his defense.

Marcus, uncertain, contemplated consulting with the prosecutor, leaving Tony frustrated and contemplating the competency of his representation, especially when Marcus mentioned needing to confirm with Prosecutor Arsenal.

Tony's insistence on summoning Rocco and Rosario to the stand underscored his determination to fight his charges head-on.

Days later, a call from Marcus introduced another financial strain: a new attorney requiring $15,000 for drafting motions. As legal expenses mounted, Marcus suggested enlisting Rosario as a defense witness, a strategy Tony immediately criticized, fearing it would only lead to Rosario's evasion.

Tony's reluctance was clear: "It's risky. Warning him might just push him further out of reach." This skepticism towards Marcus's tactics underscored Tony's growing concern over the direction and effectiveness of his defense strategy.
