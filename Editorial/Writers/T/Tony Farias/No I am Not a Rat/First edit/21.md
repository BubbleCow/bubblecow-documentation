# Chapter 21
Contemplating the lucrative potential Tony's case presented, Fat Marcus reached out to Lydia, hoping to coordinate a meeting with Rocco and Rosario.

"Lydia, hope all's well. I need to discuss Tony Sicily's situation with Rocco and Rosario. Can we arrange that?"

"Sure, Marcus. How about this Thursday at 10 a.m.?" Lydia proposed.

"Perfect. See you then," Marcus confirmed, seeing an opportunity to further his own interests.

Seated in the lavish confines of Rocco's Coral Gables home, Marcus laid out Tony's defense strategy, highlighting the evidence Tony possessed against Rocco and Rosario. He detailed Tony's intention to subpoena them, hinting at the potential for public scandal.

Rocco, with a long-standing familiarity with Marcus, made a proposition to safeguard their reputations by financially incentivizing Marcus to compromise Tony's defense.

With a handshake sealing the deal, Marcus assured them of his cooperation, betraying Tony's trust for personal gain.
