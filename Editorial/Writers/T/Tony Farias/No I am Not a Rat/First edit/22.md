# Chapter 22
With the trial looming, Tony visited Marcus's office, ready to settle his legal fees, blissfully ignorant of the clandestine discussions that had taken place.

"Tony, there's a plea deal on the table from Arsenal. Plead guilty, and he'll push for a lighter sentence, but you'd need to testify against Valerio," Marcus briefed him, gauging his reaction.

"And your response to that was...?" Tony probed, expecting Marcus had already dismissed the proposal on his behalf.

"I'm obligated to present you with any offers from the prosecution," Marcus reminded him.

"Then make it clear to him â€” I'm no informant," Tony asserted, his stance unwavering. "What's the status on our trial prep? Are the subpoenas for Rocco and Rosario in motion?"

"Yes, we're on track. Everything will be set for the trial," Marcus reassured him, though his words lacked the conviction Tony sought.

Leaving Marcus's office, Tony remained oblivious to the betrayal brewing within. Marcus, meanwhile, sat back, satisfied with his machinations, now focused on fulfilling his end of the bargain with Arsenal.

Later, discussing his growing doubts over Marcus's loyalty with Angelina, Tony expressed his unease. Angelina, attempting to soothe his worries, reminded him of their long-standing relationship with Marcus. "He's been in our corner for decades, Tony. Trust that he'll come through," she advised, hoping to dispel his concerns.
