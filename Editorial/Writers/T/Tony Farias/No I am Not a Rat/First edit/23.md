# Chapter 23
On an early October Monday in 2014, Tony and Angelina prepared for a crucial day at the federal court in downtown Miami. Tony, in a sharp navy blue Italian suit complemented by a white shirt and red tie, and Angelina, turning heads in a stunning red dress and high heels, presented a united front.

Upon passing the security measures of the court building, they rendezvoused with Fat Marcus on the twelfth floor, outside courtroom one. Marcus guided them to their designated table on the left side of the courtroom, arranging the seating with himself on the aisle and Tony directly beside him.

The prosecutor's setup was opposite, with the jury box awaiting its occupants. At the courtroom's heart stood the judge's bench, where Judge Donald Middleton would oversee the proceedings, flanked by positions for the court clerk and reporter. Notably, evidence including cases of Marlboros and a display outlining the financial aspects of the case adorned one side of the room.

Assistant District Attorney Federico Arsenal, alongside a presumed assistant, both noticeably younger and earnest, were already present, engaging in a discussion near their table. Among them were Pepe and Renato, the ATF agents integral to Tony's charges.

As proceedings commenced, the courtroom rose in respect for Judge Middleton, an individual whose demeanor suggested both wisdom and impartiality. The case against Tony, identified in court documents as conspiracy related to purportedly stolen goods, was formally introduced.

Regrettably, Fat Marcus's handling of the defense left much to be desired. His lackluster approach to motion arguments and a faltering cross-examination of the prosecution's witness markedly contrasted with Arsenal's meticulous and compelling presentation. The playback of recorded conversations involving Tony particularly underscored the prosecution's narrative, casting doubt on Tony's innocence.

Disheartened by the day's events, Tony considered dismissing Fat Marcus, fearing the potential impact of his attorney's apparent ineptitude on the trial's outcome. However, Angelina counseled patience, hoping for a turnaround in their defense strategy.
