# Chapter 24
On their way to court the next day, Tony revisited his concerns about Fat Marcus's competence. Angelina, maintaining her stance, urged patience.

In court, Fat Marcus's lack of familiarity with legal protocols became glaringly evident. His attempt to present an unauthorized document to the jury was promptly objected to by Arsenal, with the judge upholding the objection and educating Marcus on proper court procedures.

His cross-examinations were uninspired, often seeking guidance from Tony on questioning strategy, which further highlighted his inadequacies. The situation deteriorated when Stefano Valerio, once Tony's co-defendant turned state's witness, took the stand. Valerio contradicted earlier statements, claiming Tony had indicated the cigarettes were stolen and denying any return of a mistakenly wired $180,000, despite Tony's immediate rectification of the error.

Efforts to summon Rocco for testimony faltered as he and his wife became unreachable, leaving a significant gap in the defense's strategy.

With Arsenal concluding his case on the back of Valerio's damning testimony, Tony resolved to take the stand in his own defense, a move fraught with risk but necessary.

During Tony's testimony, Fat Marcus's line of questioning remained superficial, failing to address the core of the allegations. However, Arsenal's cross-examination was relentless, casting Tony in an untrustworthy light and challenging his integrity with references to past criminal behavior and insinuations of dishonesty.

Tony defended his character and intentions, insisting on his ignorance of the cigarettes' alleged stolen status and criticizing Arsenal's prosecutorial approach as misaligned with the pursuit of justice.

As the exchange between Tony and Arsenal intensified, Tony's insistence on his innocence and critique of the prosecution's motives highlighted the trial's contentious nature, leaving his fate hanging in the balance.
