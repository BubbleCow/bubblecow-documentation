# Chapter 25
The morning after Tony's testimony, both he and Angelina shared a somber realization about the trial's likely direction, despite Angelina's belief that Tony had presented himself convincingly on the stand. Upon their arrival in court, Tony's immediate concern was whether Rocco would fulfill his commitment to testify, a question to which Fat Marcus responded with vague reassurance, citing a conversation with Rocco's lawyer.

The pre-closing discussions highlighted a critical omission in the defense strategy as Fat Marcus declined to challenge the notion of a "buyer and seller relationship," a key element that could have negated the conspiracy charge. This decision left Tony and Angelina apprehensive about the closing arguments.

Arsenal, seizing his final opportunity to sway the jury, meticulously replayed portions of the recordings implicating Tony, accentuating his belief in the merchandise's illicit origins and the substantial profits gained, all while painting Valerio's dubious testimony as factual, concluding with a definitive accusation of guilt.

In contrast, Fat Marcus's closing attempted to humanize Tony, emphasizing his family-oriented nature and his inquiries about the legality of the cigarettes, which were met with assurances from the undercover agent. However, Marcus's narrative inexplicably shifted, inadvertently implicating Tony as Valerio's broker in the illicit dealings, a move that bewildered Tony and felt like a betrayal of his trust.

The jury's deliberation was brief, returning with a verdict just after lunch. The solemn query from Judge Middleton was met with a heavy affirmation of guilt from the jury foreman, a conclusion that, while not unexpected by Tony, cemented his fears about the trial's outcome and the impending sentence.
