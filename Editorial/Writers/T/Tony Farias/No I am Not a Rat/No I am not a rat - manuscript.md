Prologue: June 2014

Tony Sicily, an alarm went off at 6:00 a.m., the sounds of the birds in the backyard. Recently, he had set
up a series of bird feeders in his backyard, Woodpeckers knocking on the palm trees, cardinals and
bluejays singing Even colorful miniature parrots make a lot of noise. It is a bird paradise.
In the last few years, he has been very profitable dealing with Rocco and his Marlboro cigarettes. They
had been challenging.
He sprang from the bed and glanced around the large main bedroom. The house had been custom-built
for him and his wife, Angelina, at the end of the “gray market” in premium cigarettes. It contained over

three thousand square feet and had a two-and-a-half car garage, varnished wood floors, palm trees lining
the huge circular driveway, an inside bar, an open kitchen perfect for entertaining, and a large gazebo by
the pool. It was set on a double lot on the prestigious Riviera Drive in Coral Gables, Florida.
Wearing just his Calvin Klein boxer shorts, he checked himself out in front of the mirror, flexing his
athletic body. He was over six feet tall, 190 pounds, with salt-and-pepper hair and black eyes. He
noticed his well-defined abs and reminded himself to stop by the gym. At fifty-five years old, he could
pass for a good-looking man in his mid-forties.
His wife, Angelina, lay sleeping among colorful pillows. The silky sheets had slipped onto the floor,
revealing her naked body. At thirty-seven, she was very attractive, with smooth, silky Mediterranean
skin; long black hair, sexy black eyes, and long legs. A great dancer, her early training in ballet was
obvious.
He stepped into the shower, turned on the hot water, and lathered himself as the aromatic smell of the
bath gel filled the air. He came out and shaved himself all over, then slipped into a fresh pair of boxer
shorts, linen shorts, a polo shirt, and brown Sperry top-siders. He combed his hair with his fingers and
splashed on some cologne.
“Angelina, are you up?” Tony asked.
She opened her eyes. “Yes, where are you going?”
“I have an early meeting with Rocco at the office. I’ll stop at Versailles for coffee,” Tony replied.
“What time is it?” Angelina asked.
“Almost eight.”
“Oh my God, I have to get up! My Zumba class starts at nine.”

She jumped out of bed and rushed through the bathroom door. She looked back to see if Tony was
looking at her. She smiled at him. “Tonight,” she whispered.
Tony was on his way to the garage door when the puppy started barking. The buzzer rang; he looked
through the window to his circular driveway and spotted several black cars. His black BMW was
surrounded by agents in uniform with Uzi-type submachine guns; a couple of them had their faces
covered by ski masks and were wearing bullet-proof vests.
He frowned and shouted through the intercom, “What is going on?”
“This is the ATF,” an agent said. “Open the door.”
Tony opened the door and said, “Do you have a warrant?”
“Tony Sicily, we have a warrant for your arrest. A federal grand jury has issued an indictment.”
“You’ve got to be kidding me. What’s the charge?” Tony asked.
“We can talk about it when we get to headquarters.”
“Are you charging me with a crime?”
“Yes,” the agent replied.
“Then we got nothing to talk about. I am not a rat,” Tony said.
The bedroom door swung open, and Angelina appeared, still wrapped in her white velour robe, her long
black hair covered in a towel. She let out a hysterical scream when she spotted the ski-masked agents.
“Tony, what is going on?” she asked.

A taller-than-average agent wearing a ski mask, gun drawn, ready to pull the trigger, looked at her and
said, “Is okay, Señora. Come closer.”
Tony, his hands cuffed behind him, stepped in front of the gun. “That is my wife you’re aiming your
gum at. If you’re planning to pull the trigger, you have to go through me first.”
“Relax, Tony. We are here to arrest you,” the masked man said.
“Angelina, call Marcus. Tell him I’ve been arrested,” Tony said. He faced the officers and asked,
“Where are you taking me?”
“We are with the ATF, and we are taking you to our headquarters in Doral.”
“The ATF! What is that?” Angelina asked.
“The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives,” an agent replied.

Chapter I
The Exodus

It had been two years since La Revolucion had taken over the country. Twelve-year-old Tony Sicily was
sitting on the steps of his parents’ front porch, observing the traffic of people, beggars, and the injured
making their way to the village plaza, where the fiesta in honor of the patron saint the Virgin of
Candelaria was being celebrated. It was February 2, 1962.

Maria, Tony’s cousin, had come over from Miami for the celebration. She had moved to Miami about
four years earlier on a worker’s contract. She was of medium build, in her mid-thirties. She sat by his
side and pulled out a pack of Viceroy American cigarettes.
“May I have one?” Tony asked.
“Tony, if your father’s bus drives by and Alcides sees you smoking, you are going to get in trouble,” she
said.
“It’s okay; he knows I smoke. I’ve been smoking American cigarettes since I was eight. I’m twelve now,
and I work in the warehouse,” he said. “I want to go to Miami. I don’t like La Revolucion. We cannot
get ham, bread, or American cigarettes.”
“What warehouse are you working at?” she asked. “You are just a kid.”
“Sabatez, unloading trucks of detergents.”
“You are not playing baseball anymore?”
“All the time. I go to Cascorro’s poor neighborhood and play con los Negros,” Tony said.

Two months later

Tony found himself on a flight to Miami, trying to remember everything his father and mother had said
to him at the Havana airport. I don’t understand why I have to ask for a guy named George—something
about Pedro Pam and a camp in Miami, he thought. Why can I not stay with my cousin?

Tony felt warm under the sweater his mother had made him wear. He tilted his Panama hat and asked
the steward for a cold Coca-Cola. The pilot was announcing their approach to Miami.
After the plane landed, he stood up and walked slowly toward the staircase, let the air out of his lungs,
and wondered about his future in Miami. As he went through Customs, Tony started asking everyone,
“Are you George?” Finally, a man in his mid-forties, medium build, and brown hair stopped him and
asked, “Estas solo?”
“Si, usted es George?” Tony asked.
“Ven conmigo, nos vamos a reunir co los otros,” he said.
Tony and George approached an elderly man standing by a van with another six kids of different ages.
“Brother Pedro, this is the last flight today. We can go to the camp,” George said.
Tony got in the van and started to introduce himself to the group. They all were scared. The van pulled
away from the airport and drove for almost an hour.
The camp consisted of several one-story buildings and a basketball court next to a baseball field. They
got out at the main building, and Brother Pedro said, “Come, children, we have some milk and
sandwiches for you.” They entered the reception area, and there it was: a cigarette vending machine.
Tony smiled—he had a feeling he was going to like this place.

One year later

Life at the camp was very busy. The boys had school in the morning with the Marist brothers, who also
had a school in Havana, and in the afternoons, they played basketball or baseball.
The basketball coach held tryouts for a thirteen-and-under team, and Tony made the cut. He had a great
game against a visiting team from the city.
On weekends, the Marist Brothers would bus a group of kids to Miami Beach to swim in the ocean and
have a picnic. On one of those outings, Tony met his first love in Miami. While walking along the shore,
he spotted a beautiful girl swimming near the shoreline. She called to him and asked him to swim with
her. She was almost as tall as Tony, with blonde hair, the most beautiful blue eyes he had ever seen, and
long legs. She was wearing a bikini.
“What’s your name?” she asked.
“I’m Tony. And you?”
“My name is Virginia,” she said while getting close to him and starting to touch him. She pulled his
swimming shorts down and grabbed him. “Oh, wow,” she said.
She lowered her bikini and straddled him until they joined together. “Oh, Tony, you feel so big.” In that
moment, Tony knew that he was going to be addicted to that feeling forever.

Chapter II
January 2000

Tony was wondering what his business was going to be like, now that the federal government had
passed a law making the sale of “gray-market” premium cigarettes illegal. He was representing
manufacturers and importers of low-cost generic-value cigarette brands.
The morning had been hectic, with calls from customers all over the country wanting to order Marlboro
cigarettes, which were no longer available. He repeated the same pitch over and over: The gray market
was done.
His office consisted of two rooms: a reception area with a desk and a fax-copy machine in one corner,
and his private office with a cherry-wood desk, a network telephone, a computer monitor, a credenza on
the back wall that he used as a bar, and pictures on the wall of different spectacular views of golf
courses.
Tony wandered through his office and down the second-floor hall toward the main office of the
bonded/domestic warehouse of the importer with whom he placed most of his orders.
The receptionist, a knock-out blonde, was shuffling some invoices.
“Is Alfredo in his office?” Tony asked her.
“He is on the phone,” she replied.
Tony walked toward the copier and glanced into Alfredo’s assistant’s office. Chiriana winked at him as
she got up and approached the copier. She was wearing a Diane Von Furstenberg wraparound dress. She
had a full figure and long black hair, was showing a little cleavage, and had a fire in her eyes.
“C’mon, Tony, I got to make some copies,” she said while rubbing her magnificent breasts teasingly
against his arms. “Same place at five-thirty,” she whispered.
He winked, acknowledging the date.

A voice sounded from Alfredo’s office. “Chiriana, will you come to my office?” he asked.
She smiled. “Coming!”

As Tony arrived at his office the following morning, his mind wandered into last evening’s episode. It
was explosive!
His cell phone rang.
“Hello, this is Tony.”
“Tony, I didn’t see you at the gym last night,” Alfredo said. “The basketball courts were jammed. I
needed you on my team. Where were you?”
Tony paused. “I had a meeting in Fort Lauderdale, trying to push Optimum to a customer. The
customers are telling me to get back to them when the 100s are in.”
“I placed the order with the factory. The 100s will be here in three weeks,” Alfredo said.
“I need to call you back. I’m getting a call from Ohio.”

Chapter III
The Rats

“Hi, Rob. I was on the phone when your call came in. What’s up?” Tony asked.

“Hi, Tony. We just had a meeting with a couple of guys from Miami. They want us to pick up their
brand Maxxon, manufactured in Paraguay.”
“Who are they?”
“Rocco and Rosario,” Rob said. “They said that Mark gave them a $100,000 deposit for 10,000 master
cases, sixty cartons to a case, and asked us to wire the balance: $4.5 million.”
“Wow, that’s 600,000 cartons if I’m doing the math correctly. That comes out to $7.50 per carton, which
is over a dollar above market value,” Tony said. “Has Mark gone loco or what?”
“Tony, we could move the cigarettes at the right price, one truckload at a time. We are not going to pay
in advance. Do you know these guys?” Rob asked.
“No, I never heard of them. I’ll ask around.”
“We told them that you handle all our purchases out of Miami and that you are our broker; so please
establish the right price, and we will send you the money to pay for the truckload when we need them[A1]
,” Rob said.
“Did you get their number?” Tony asked.
“No, I don’t want to deal with this. I gave them your number,” Rob said.
“Okay, I will handle them,” Tony said.
Tony paused for a second, picked up his office phone, and dialed Alfredo’s extension.
“Alfredo, do you know these importers Rocco and Rosario?” Tony asked.
There was silence on the other end of the line. Finally, Alfredo said, “Yes, I know them. Why?”

“They met one of my customers in Ohio and tried to push their brand, Maxxon, made in Paraguay. Rob
told them to come see me since I’m their broker down here.”
“Tony, keep this in mind: These Rocco and Rosario are not to be trusted. Never wire funds in advance to
them! Are you going to the gym later?”
“No, I have a late meeting. Then I’m taking Angelina out to dinner,” Tony replied. He thought, Well,
according to Alfredo, he had to be extremely careful with these guys.

Chapter IV
Port Everglades, Fort Lauderdale, Florida
It was Friday afternoon in January, and the weather in Miami was spectacular: seventy-two degrees, not
a cloud in the sky. Tony called Caffe Abbracci, an Italian eatery in Coral Gables, and made a reservation
for two at 8 p.m.
“Angelina, I made a reservation at Caffe Abbracci for eight o’clock,” Tony said. “I have a meeting in
Port Everglades, so I’ll meet you there.”
“Okay, darling. Don’t be late. You know when I sit alone in a bar, all the men start buzzing around me
like flies,” Angelina said.
“If anyone bothers you, tell Benedetto, the owner. He’s a good friend.”

Tony arrived at Port Everglades, got clearance at the checkpoint, and drove to John Baldovino’s
warehouse. He went up the steps to the office and knocked on the door. John’s deep voice welcomed
him in. Inside were two old wooden desks. Beside the computer monitor on the desk on the right was a
rotary phone; beyond that, a metal cabinet showing signs of rust.
“Buona sera John, come stai?” Tony asked.
“Benne, grazie, e tu?” John replied.
“Abbastanza bene, grazie. Were you able to get rid of all your premium cigarettes?”
“Yeah. Sold everything I had before the dateline,” he said. “I am trying to manufacture a brand in
Paraguay. That is the next segment of the business that will be taking off—value brands.”
“There are a couple of guys who had a brand made in Paraguay, Rocco and Rosario. Do you know
them?” Tony asked.
“Yeah, I know them,” John said. “As a matter of fact, I talked with them about making my brand. Why
do you ask?”
“They went to see one of my customers in Ohio. The client asked me to broker the transactions. Are
these guys trustworthy?”
“A couple of rats. I wouldn’t wire money in advance to them,” John said.
“Do you know their full names and their company name?” Tony asked.
“Rogelio ‘Rocco’ Vacca and Rosario Eacobacci. Their company is Gulfstream something.”
“Okay, thanks. John, let me know when you bring your value brand. I have customers all over the
country.”

“I know. Ciao, grazie.”
While driving to Coral Gables to meet Angelina, Tony started thinking about these Rocco and Rosario
people. What did John call them? A pair of rats? It was clear that he needed to be extra careful with this
duo.

Chapter V

The black BMW pulled up in front of the restaurant. The valet, a slender young man wearing a red shirt
and black pants, greeted him by name. “Welcome, Mr. Sicily. It is nice to see you again. I will leave
your car in front.”
“Thank you, Pablo,” Tony said. “Bring my wife’s Mercedes up front as well.”
Entering through the double doors, Tony smiled to the beautiful young hostess, a stunning blonde in her
early twenties with blue eyes and a butt that would stop traffic on a crowded street.
“Good evening, Marisela. As beautiful as ever. How are you?” Tony asked.
“Mr. Sicily, you are always so gallant. I bet you say that to every woman,” Marisela said. “I am very
well, thank you. And how you are?”
“I say that only to the pretty ones, Marisela. I am fine, grazie,” Tony said, smiling.
The reception area was a cozy room. Candles lit up a Victorian couch and two armchairs in a corner. A
small lamp illuminated the reservation book on the dark wood lectern.

The deep voice of Benedetto, the owner, sounded. “Buona sera, signore Sicily. Come stai?”
“Non c’e male, il mio amico. Stai tenendo d’occhio mia moglie?” Tony asked.
“Si, lei e al bar.”
“Grazie. La tabella usual, per favore.”
Tony entered the bar area. It was dark, with several small tables to the right by the windows overlooking
Giralda Street, several ladies sitting on bar stools around them. He noticed that a couple of guys were
trying to talk to Angelina. She saw him and got up from the bar stool. She looked spectacular in a short
red dress, with deep cleavage enhancing her full breasts. She could pass for a supermodel.
“Tony! Que bueno que llegastes. Ese par de moscones no me dejavan tranquila[A2] ,” she said and kissed
him on the lips.
“Angelina, amore, you look amazing.” Tony said. “Benedetto is getting our table ready. How about
another drink?”
“Si mi amor.”
Tony glanced at the bartender. Luca was serving two ladies at the corner of the bar. He spotted Tony and
came over, smiling.
“Buona sera Luca. Come va?” Tony asked.
“Bene, grazie. E lei?” Luca replied.
“Abbastanza bene, grazie. Un cosmopolita per il ladie, e il solito black label sulle rocce.”
“How was your meeting?” Angelina asked.

“It went well,” Tony said.
Marisela approach them at the bar and said, “Mr. and Mrs. Sicily, your table is ready. Your drinks will be
taken to your table. Please follow me.”
Tony left a twenty-dollar bill on the bar and followed Marisela and Angelina to the main dining room.
They were walking side by side; he looked at their legs, raised his eyes to their butts, and smiled. After a
pause, he noticed both of them watching him out of the corner of their eyes while flicking their hair with
their hands. This must be a symbol of an animal sexual attraction between a man and a woman, he
thought.
The dining room was spacious, with two rows of square tables separated by a row of round, larger tables
in the middle. The tables were covered with white linen cloths and napkins, wine and water glasses, and
shining silverware. On the walls hung pictures of celebrities—Marciano, Frank, Dino, Grace, Rita. At
their usual table on the corner, Marisela placed a leather-bound menu in front of Angelina and two
menus in front of Tony.
“Thank you, grazie, Marisela,” Tony said.
“Prego,” she replied.
The maître d’ approached the table and greeted them. “Buona sera, Mr. and Mrs. Sicily. Benbenutti a
Caffe Abbracci. Here are your drinks. Will you be ordering wine for dinner?”
“Si, per favore. Una Bottiglia di Casanova Di Neri, Brunello. And for dinner, I will start with a small
Caesar salad with anchovies, and the lady will have fettuccine dolce vita, and I will have veal marsala.
Grazie, Paolo,” Tony said.
“Molto bene sinore Sicily,” Paolo said.

Later that evening …

“Tony, come over and unzip me,” Angelina said after they had returned to the warmth of their bedroom.
“Tony, were you comparing butts?”
Tony unzipped her dress and took a step back. She was wearing nothing underneath. She arched her
back and raised her arms to the sky.
“What do you think?” she asked.
“Oh my god, spectacular,” Tony exclaimed.

Chapter VI
The Rats …

The following morning, Tony’s cell phone rang.
“Tony, this is Rocco. Rob gave me your number. We need to have a meeting.”
“Hi, Rocco, I was expecting your call. Do you want to come over to my office?” Tony asked.
“Where is your office?”

“It’s in the same building as Alfredo’s warehouse.”
“Hmmm … I see. Tell you what: Let’s meet at Houston in Coral Gables for lunch,” Rocco said.
“Okay, how about 1 p.m.?” Tony said.
“Good. We will be there.”
Tony paused for a moment to think; he did not like this. “Hmmm, by Rocco, maybe he did not want
Alfredo to see him meeting with me. I need to be careful with this character.”

Houston in Coral Gables was a crowded place with quality food and a wraparound bar full of ladies. Its
mostly private booths made it perfect for business meetings.
Tony took a spot at the bar and ordered a Johnny Walker Black Label while looking over the crowd,
trying to spot Rocco and Rosario based on Alfredo’s description of them. He did not see anyone that
resembled them, so he kept his eyes on the door, trying not to be distracted by several knock-out ladies.
Finally, two guys walked in. One was taller than average, in his mid-forties, kind of heavyset, with a
look that made you want to trust him. This must be Rocco. The other was of average height and older
than Rocco.
Tony waved in their direction and they joined him at the bar. After their introductions, Tony ordered
drinks for them, and then a beautiful young lady escorted them to their table.
“Have you been here before?” Rocco asked.

“Yes, several times. The food and ambience are good,” Tony replied. “I got a call from Rob about you
and your brand Maxxon, and now he is interested in being your exclusive distributor in Ohio and
Northern Indiana.”
“Okay. He needs to wire us $4.5 million to pay for the 10,000 master cases that Mark ordered from us,”
Rocco said.
“Oh, I see,” Tony said. “Here’s the problem: Rob and Mark are not willing to wire any funds to you.
Rather, they will wire the funds to me, I will inspect the product and the paperwork, and if everything is
in order, I will wire the funds to you, one truckload at a time.”
Rocco’s face tightened up. Tony could see the anger in his eyes as he said, “Who do you think you are?”
“I am Rob and Mark’s broker in Miami, and this is the only way this deal is going down. And something
else: Your price is a dollar too high. They’re willing to pay $6.50 per carton, and you will pay me
twenty-five cents commission.”
Rocco’s face was turning red. His right hand hardened into a fist. Rosario touched him on the arm and
that seemed to relax him.
“Okay, when do you want to come over and inspect the product?” Rocco asked.
“Where is the product?” Tony asked.
“We have it in the Free Zone.”
“Let’s do it on Monday at 10 a.m.,” Tony said. “Do you have a fax number? I’ll fax the purchase order
for a truckload, 40,000 cartons.”
They exchanged business cards and shook hands. “Let’s order some food and drinks,” Rocco said.

“Rob and Mark will go through your 10,000 master cases in six to eight months,” Tony said.

************

Once the meeting was over and Rocco and Rosario were alone, Rocco said, “Rosario, one day I am
going to get this guy.”
“Come on, Rocco. All he is trying to do is protect his customers.”
“I will get him,” Rocco said with a sinister smile.

Chapter VII
October 2003

Rocco and Rosario were inspecting a shipment of unstamped premium cigarettes. They were planning to
ship them to a retailer in Pensacola, Florida, without the state stamp. It had been over a year now[A3] ,
and they were able to falsify invoices and put the tax money in their pockets.
Rocco was in the middle of the warehouse, giving instruction to Billy, who was driving the forklift,
when several unmarked black cars suddenly pulled up to the loading dock. Uniformed and
non-uniformed law enforcement officers charged up the ramp, pulling their guns out and screaming,
“Don’t move! Hands up! You are under arrest!”

“Hey what’s going on? Do you have a warrant?” Rocco asked.
“Yes, we do,” a non-uniformed detective said.
“Who are you with?”
“The ATF, state division.”
“What’s the charge?” Rosario asked.
“There are several felony counts, including possession of unstamped cigarettes without a license.”
“I need to make a phone call,” Rocco said.
“You will, after we book you. Let’s go.”

Chapter VIII
Six Months Later

Tony’s business had slowed down. He was calling manufacturers overseas, trying to land an exclusive
representation that he could offer his customers. Some of the local importers had seen their brands
de-listed in many states for lack of payment to the master settlement agreement[A4] .
His cell phone rang.
“Tony, this is Rocco. How are you? Listen, I have a friend of mine in town with his girlfriend and they
want to play tennis. Can you play?”

“Sure,” Tony said. “Where are we playing? I haven’t played in a month, so I’m a little rusty.”
“At the Biltmore. When we’re done, we’ll have a drink in the bar. My friend has products that you could
move,” Rocco said.

At the Biltmore Tennis Center, Rocco introduced Tony to Renato and Ashley. Renato was Rocco’s
tennis partner, and Ashley played with Tony. Ashley was of average height, with blonde hair, blue eyes,
and nice legs, while Renato on the short side, with a dark skin tone, black hair, and a look in his eyes
like he was the delinquent type.
After their second match, they went to the bar inside the hotel and ordered drinks.
“Where are you from, Renato?” Tony asked.
“I was born in the Dominican Republic but grew up in New York City,” Renato said. “Say, do you have
contacts with the Indian tribes in upstate New York?”
“Yes, I do. Why?” Tony replied.
“I can get Marlboros.”
“Tony, this is a great opportunity,” Rocco said. “You could probably move truckloads.”
“Gray-market Marlboros are illegal,” Tony said.
“These are domestic Marlboros, manufactured by Philip Morris,” Rocco said.
“How did you get them?”
“You don’t want to know,” Renato said.

“I’m going to pass. What I need is a good-quality value brand that I could sell to the Indians.”
“Come on, Tony. You can make a lot of money with these Marlboros,” Rocco said.
“No, I’m not interested. I am leaving for Las Vegas tomorrow for a trade show. Good luck,” Tony said.
Later, after Tony left, Ashley, Renato, and Rocco stayed behind, conspiring their next move to entrap
Tony.
“This guy is smart. We have to be careful not to blow our cover,” Renato said.
“He is so good-looking,” Ashley said.
“He likes money,” Rocco said. “He will fall in the trap.”

Chapter IX
Las Vegas

Tony packed his carry-on bag, got in his BMW, and headed to Miami International Airport on his way to
Las Vegas to attend an International Tobacco Trade Show. At the gate, he called Angelina.
“Angelina, I’m on my way to Las Vegas to attend a trade show. I’ll be staying at the Las Vegas Hilton,
right next to the convention center.”
“Okay, darling. Call me when you land,” she said.

Tony was able to upgrade his ticket to first class, so he had a very comfortable five-hour flight, enjoying
a couple of scotches and a nap along the way.

While walking toward the taxi line, his cell phone rang. “Hello, this is Tony.”
“Hey, Tony. This is Mark. Are you in Vegas?”
“Yes, I am. What about you?”
“Yes. I got a suite at the Mandalay. Where are you staying?”
“I’m staying at the Hilton. Did Rob come over with you?”
“No, he’s in Florida this time of the year.”
“Okay, I’m going to check in and take a nap. I’ll call you later.”

***************
After he checked into his room, he headed straight for the shower. When he came out, he dried himself
off, pulled on a pair of boxer shorts, and lay in the fluffy king-size bed. His cell phone rang.
“Tony, this is Rocco. Are you in Vegas? Are you planning to see Mark?”
“Yes, I’ll see Mark. What about?”
“Do you think he will be interested in the Marlboros?”
“I doubt it. His family buys Marlboros direct.”

“What about your Indian customers? At least ask them.”

************

The next morning, while getting his badge to get access to the trade show, Tony checked out all the
beautiful ladies walking toward the entrance of the trade show to work the different booths.
As he walked along the aisles, stopping in several booths along the way and admiring the different pairs
of legs inside the booths, one woman in particular grabbed his attention. She was very attractive, of
medium height, with dark brown hair and green eyes; her skin was that of a mixed-race person. He
approached her and said, “Good morning. You have to be the most beautiful model in the show.”
“Oh thank you. You are not bad yourself. Let me scan your badge.”
“Such a beautiful accent—where are you from?” Tony asked.
“I am from Jamaica,” she said. “What about you? Are you Italian?”
“My ancestors are; I was born in Cuba. How about a drink after the show?”
“Maybe,” she said. “I finish at five.”

Chapter X

November 2005

Tony was sitting at his desk going over some paperwork. Business was very slow. Some of the brands he
represented had been de-listed for lack of payment to the master settlement agreement, so he decided to
call his customers in upstate New York.
“Karina, how are you? How is business on the reservation?” Tony asked.
“Tony, I’m doing fine. And you?”
“Ah, business is very slow. I don’t have product to sell. Is there anything I can get for you?”
“I’m having a hard time getting anyone to sell me premiums. Can you help me with that?”
“I can check down here to see if anyone is selling. How do we ship them?”
“I’ll email you Valerio’s information. He owns Piedmont Freight. I use them to bring cargo here to
Salamanca.”
Tony started thinking about how long it had been since he had been introduced to Karina by a mutual
friend in Ohio. They had become good friends right off the bat, and now she was running a large
distributorship on the Indian reservation in Salamanca, New York.

**************

Rocco, Renato, and Rosario were meeting at Rocco’s house in Coral Gables.

“Rocco, you have to get this guy Tony to agree to purchase these Marlboros and make him believe that
they’re stolen,” Renato said. “That’s part of your plea bargain agreement with the prosecutor, that you
will cooperate with the ATF.”
“I know. Let me call him again,” Rocco said.
“Tell him to come to Roberto’s warehouse, and we will have there a couple of cases for him to inspect,”
Renato said.
Rocco tapped Tony’s number into his cell phone. “Tony, this is Rocco. Listen, we’re bringing a new
cigarette and we want you to handle the sales. Please come to our bonded warehouse on 97th Avenue
and 16th street, tomorrow at 10 a.m.”
“Okay. Text me the address,” Tony said.

The next morning, the ATF was in a van outside the warehouse and setting up video cameras and wire
taps when a large SUV came to a stop in the parking lot. A tall, heavyset man got out, and one of the
ATF agents said, “That’s the CIA.” A few minutes later, Tony arrived in his BMW. The agent said, “That
is the subject.”
The front office had a few desks with a few employees at computer terminals; everything looked legit.
“Can I help you?” a young lady asked.
“I’m here to see Rocco,” Tony replied.
“He is in the back with Roberto.”

The warehouse consisted of several rows of full pallets of different brands of cigarettes and a couple of
forklifts. There was a desk in the back, and two bay doors on a loading dock.
Tony walked in, and Rocco greeted him. “Hi, Tony. This is Roberto, a friend; he runs this bonded
facility for a large overseas tobacco company.”
“Hi, nice to meet you,” Tony said.
“Tony, you remember Renato. We want to show you two cases of Marlboros.”
“Please open them,” Renato said.
“Inspect them,” Tony said. “They have all the markings of domestic Marlboros.”
“They are domestic Marlboros, manufactured in Virginia,” Renato said. “I can sell you these two cases
at seventeen dollars a carton. You can take them to your warehouse.”
“No, I cannot have these in my warehouse. Do you have more, like a couple of hundred cases?” Tony
asked.
“Yes, I do,” Renato said.
“Okay, give me a breakdown of how many cases are red and how many cases are white. I’ll call a
customer in New York.”

Chapter XI

The sting begins:
After exchanging telephone numbers with Renato, Tony left the warehouse and started thinking
that this could be an opportunity to make some money and help Karina at the same time.
The next day, he got the numbers from Renato and established that Tony was going to pay with a
cashier’s check.
“Karina,” Tony said into the phone. “I got 192 cases of Marlboros at nineteen dollars a carton. Do you
want them?”
“Yes,” she answered. “I’ll call Valerio, and he’ll pick them up for me.”
“Karina, you need to wire the money in advance to my account.”
“Fax your invoice to Zulema, Valerio’s sister. She will wire the funds to you.”

**********

“Valerio, this is Tony. Karina gave me your number. I got 192 cases of Marlboros that need to be picked
up from a warehouse in Miami for her. When can you pick them up?”
“I can pick them up on Thursday. Fax the invoice and the bill of lading to my office, and Zulema will
wire the funds to you,” Valerio said.

*************

The pick-up was arranged for eleven o’clock Thursday morning. After checking his bank account and
making sure the wire had come in, Tony stopped in the bank and purchased a cashier’s check for
$195,840 to pay for the cigarettes and headed to the bonded warehouse.
At the warehouse, Tony, Rocco, and Renato were waiting for the truck loaded with six pallets of
Marlboros to arrive. The back-door bell sounded, and a guy of medium height with black hair and a
black beard and wearing overalls and a T-shirt walked in. Renato introduced him: “Tony, this is Pepe,
my partner.”
“Nice to meet you. We can unload your truck. The commercial freight truck will be arriving shortly,”
Tony said.
“You have the cashier’s check?” Pepe asked.
“Yes, I do. Here it is: $195,840 for 11,520 cartons at $17 a carton.” Tony showed them the check.
Once the six pallets were unloaded, Tony had the warehouse boy open several cases for inspection, to
make sure he was getting exactly what he was paying for. He then asked the warehouse boy to wrap
them in black and call the piedmont driver to come by and pick them up.
Once the truck was loaded, he handed over the cashier’s check and told Rocco and Renato, “Let me
know when you have more.”

***********

After Tony left, Rocco, Renato, and Pepe started to plan their next move.
“This is perfect for us,” Rocco said.
“Renato has been transferred to New York, so I will be the lead between the ATF and you,” Pepe told
Rocco[A5] . “We have to make this guy believe that these Marlboros are stolen, and if he ever asks, we
deny it. Now we are going to cool off for several months, even if he calls us. That way, he will think
they are stolen.”

Chapter XII

Tony called Renato repeatedly over the next few months, but the call went to voice mail every time.
Could it be that this guy got busted or killed? Tony thought. In his line of work, everything is possible.
He decided to call Rocco.
“Rocco, this is Tony. Have you heard from Renato?”
“I think he went to the Dominican Republic. Why don’t you call Pepe? Here’s his number,” Rocco said
and rattled off the digits.
Tony dialed Pepe’s number and got voice mail, so he left a message.

One evening while having dinner with Angelina, he mentioned that business was slow and that he was
going to the southern trade show in Myrtle Beach.

While walking the trade show, he spotted Karina. An attractive woman in her mid-fifties, she was
wearing a white shirt over black pants,. She flicked her hair when she saw Tony.
“Hi, Tony. How are you?” she said.
“I’m good. Trying to sell something. It’s getting tougher all the time.”
“Do you have any more premiums?”
“I’m trying. You’ll be the first to know if I do.”
“Okay, honey, let me know. Oh, I need some Rodger’s. Can you sell me some?” she asked.
“Yes, send me the order.”

************

Before Tony realized it, 2008 had begun. He got a call from Rocco that Pepe had come across some
Marlboros if Tony could help them out.
“Do you want me to call Pepe?” Tony asked.
“Yes, please. He is waiting for your call,” Rocco said, smiling to himself.

Tony called Pepe right away, unaware that his call was being recorded. “Pepe, this is Tony. How are
you?”
“Listen, Tony, I got over 400 cases this time, and they are hot,” Pepe said.
“Wow! Where are you getting these? You’re not stealing them, are you?”
“You don’t want to know the answer to that,” Pepe said. “I will text you the breakdown and I will have
them ready for pick-up next Tuesday.”
“Okay. I will arrange the pick-up,” Tony said.
After getting the text from Pepe, Tony called Valerio.
“Valerio, I need a truck to pick up 450 master cases of Marlboros—250 for Karina and 200 for you,”
Tony said. “They will be ready next Tuesday morning. I’ll fax the invoices to Zulema. Please wire the
funds no later than Monday.”
“Thank you, Tony,” Valerio said.

Chapter XIII
March 2009

It had been a few months since, in a sting operation, they’d sold 450 cases to Tony, and Pepe and Rocco
were planning the next truckload. Rocco suggested that they should send their telephone number to
Valerio with the truck driver so he would deal directly with them.[A6]

They decided that Pepe would call Tony and offer the 600 cases they had available, and while Tony was
checking the cargo, Rocco would give their cell phone numbers to the driver to pass on to Valerio.
Pepe called Tony and let him know about the 600 cases of Marlboros and the new price of nineteen
dollars a carton. Tony made the arrangement with Valerio to send a truck and asked him to wire the
funds. He tagged five dollars’ profit per carton in this transaction for himself.

******************

Upon arriving at the warehouse to conduct the transaction, Tony spotted and waved to Roberto in the
front office. Roberto motioned him to the back of the warehouse, where Pepe and Rocco were
supervising the unloading of their truck.
“Tony, how are you?” Rocco said. “Please call the driver and tell him we are ready for him.”
“Hi, guys. I’m fine. We need to wait till you finish unloading so I can count them,” Tony said.
“You can start counting them,” Pepe said. “There are 430 reds and 170 whites.”
Once the piedmont driver arrived and Tony was supervising the loading, Rocco sneaked to the driver
and gave him a piece of paper bearing their telephone numbers and instructions for Valerio to call them
directly.
After the truck was loaded, Tony gave the cashier’s check to Pepe, and Pepe said, “I’ll let you know
when I have some more.”

Chapter XIV
June 2014

After his arrest, Tony was taken to an office in the Doral area for interrogation. He was asked if he
wanted to cooperate and become a confidential informant. “No way! If you are charging me with a
crime, I want my attorney present to answer any questions.”
Then Pepe, the guy in the ski mask, finally unmasked himself.
“Tony, do you remember me? I’m Pepe, with the Marlboros. I was the undercover agent in the sting
operation.”
“I have never seen you in my life,” Tony said.
“No. Remember Rocco and Rosario and Valerio, the customer in New York?”
“I do not know any Valerio in New York.”
Tony was transferred to the federal detention center to be booked and placed in a cell.
Tony realized Rocco and Rosario had really set him up, and with all the money he had given them in
kickbacks. The pair of rats. “I should have known better than to trust those scumbags.”
The guards kept exchanging prisoners, taking one out and bringing another one in. Some tried to talk to
Tony, but he remained tight-lipped. In the meantime, waiting his arraignment and bond hearing, hours

went by. Finally, around 4:00 p.m., the guards came to get him, making sure the shackles were secure
and handcuffs were tight.
A trio of armed police officers walked him for what seemed like half a mile through an underground
tunnel to the courthouse.
When he entered the courtroom, he spotted his wife and Fat Marcus, his attorney. When his turn came
up, the assistant district attorney read the charges against him, and Tony entered a plea of not guilty. Bail
was set at $200,000.

*************

Once Tony posted bail, he came and greeted Angelina and Fat Marcus.
“Tony, Caballo, come to my office tomorrow at 10:30 a.m.,” Fat Marcus said. “In the meantime, I will
call the prosecutor and find out what he wants.”

The following morning, Tony showed up in Fat Marcus’s office and waited in the reception area. The
office had a window for customers to ring a bell and two other offices with desk chairs and picture
frames on the walls.
The receptionist motioned Tony into Marcus’s office. Fat Marcus was a huge guy, well over six feet tall
and nearly 300 pounds. “Caballo, how are you?” Fat Marcus said.
“I’m fine. A little depressed. And you?”

“I am okay. I just spoke to the prosecutor regarding discovery.”
“What is the district attorney’s name?” Tony asked.
“Federico Arsenal. Seems like a nice guy. He says they have a bunch of voice recordings going back
eight years, including videos of you and two undercover ATF officers and two confidential informants.”
“It’s got to be Rocco and Rosario. They’re the ones who brought these guys to me,” Tony said.
“You got to be kidding me! Rocco and Rosario? Let me call Rocco’s wife. She used to work in the
district attorney’s office.”
“How much is this going to cost me?” Tony asked.
“I have to charge fifty thousand: twenty-five K now and the balance before we go to trial,” Marcus said.
“Wow. I’ll bring the checkbook to our next meeting. In the meantime, find out as much as you can.”

Chapter XV

Two days later …
Tony sat in Fat Marcus’s office and handed him a check for $25,000, saying, “I will get you the balance
before the trial starts.”

“I spoke to Rocco’s wife,” Marcus said. “She claims she did not know anything about this case, but she
did admit that Rocco had a problem with the state around 2004.”
“It was him and Rosario who brought this deal to me.”
“I requested a copy of the indictment and all the tapes and videos the prosecutor has,” Fat Marcus said.
“You better get somebody to investigate Rocco and Rosario and the ATF undercover agents. I want to
know where the money went.”
“That is going to cost another $10,000,” Fat Marcus said.
“I got no choice. I gave kickbacks to Rocco. I have copies of the cashier’s checks.”
“What about your codefendant Valerio? He is facing fifteen years plus fines. The word from his attorney
is that he might testify against you.”
“The scumbag—I always protected him,” Tony said.

**************

The next time Tony was waiting in the reception area to see Fat Marcus, a couple of minutes late, the
receptionist came to get him and invited him to join Fat Marcus in his office.
“Tony, this is Nayib, a private investigator. He will be joining our team. He will bill us by the hour,” Fat
Marcus said.

Nayib was taller than the average man and had thin, dark hair. He told Tony that he had been a police
detective for twenty years.
“Nice to meet you,” Tony said. “I need you to investigate the confidential informants and the undercover
agents. I have a feeling they have a lot of dirty laundry.”

Chapter XVI
One month later …

Fat Marcus and Nayib called Tony to a meeting in Marcus’s office. Nayib had a lot of information on
Rocco and Rosario and a confidential audit report on the ATF.
“We need to be able to use this information in the trial as part of my defense. What about the cashier’s
check that I gave Rocco?” Tony asked.
“It was deposited in a bank on Key Biscayne to a company owned by Rosario,” Nayib said. “It seems
that Rocco was busted in 2004 and was facing eight felony counts. He made a deal and pleaded guilty to
eight misdemeanor counts and became an ATF informant.”
“What about this ATF audit?” Tony asked.

“It details that from 2006 to 2013, over 6 million cartons of cigarettes remained unaccounted for, and
well over $8 million in funds,” Nayib said.
“Marcus, can we introduce any of these facts in the trial as part of my defense?” Tony asked.
“I do not know. I will have to call the prosecutor,” Marcus said.
“I want to subpoena Rocco and Rosario to appear in the trial,” Tony said.
Tony did not like Fat Marcus’s statement that he needed to check with Arsenal. Who was he working
for? He was beginning to have doubts about Fat Marcus. He left the meeting wondering if he had made
the right choice.

************
A few days later, Tony got a call from Fat Marcus. He wanted him to come over to meet with an
attorney who was going to be writing the motions for him … for another $15,000. The legal fees were
beginning to be a burden.
“Tony, I want to approach Rosario and ask him to appear as a defense witness to help out,” Fat Marcus
said.
“I don’t think that is a good idea. If you approach him, he’s going to disappear,” Tony said. “If you tip
him off, we’ll never get him to appear.”

Chapter XVII

Marcus e tu![A7]
Fat Marcus was sitting at his desk, thinking that he could probably make a lot more money off Tony’s
case. He called Lydia, Rocco’s wife.
“Lydia, how are you? I need to come over and meet with Rocco and Rosario regarding this Tony Sicily
case.”
“Marcus, I am fine. Why don’t you come over Thursday morning, around ten?” Lydia said.
“I will be there, thanks.”

From the overstuffed sofa in Rocco’s mansion in Coral Gables, Fat Marcus told Rocco and Rosario
everything about Tony’s case. “He has copies of cashier’s checks he claims he gave you, Rocco, and that
were deposited in a company owned by Rosario. He wants me to subpoena you and Rosario to appear at
the trial. It will be embarrassing.”
“Marcus, you’ve known me and Rosario for a long time,” Rocco said. “We cannot allow ourselves to be
embarrassed by this guy. We will give you forty thousand cash if you throw Tony under the bus.”
Marcus smiled and extended his hand to Rocco. “Consider it done,” Fat Marcus said.

Chapter XVIII

Two weeks before his trial, Tony, unaware of what had been going on behind his back, showed up in
Marcus’s office with his checkbook in hand to pay the balance on his account.
“Tony, Caballo. Arsenal is making an offer. You plead guilty, and he will recommend a minimum
sentence, but you have to testify against Valerio,” Fat Marcus said.
“Did you give him my answer?”
“By law I have to inform you of the prosecutor’s deals,” Fat Marcus said.
“Well tell him no, I am not a rat,” Tony said. “Are we ready for the trial? How about those subpoenas;
have you been able to serve then?”
“We are working on it. We will be ready for trial.”
Tony left the office, unsuspecting of Fat Marcus’s treason. Marcus leaned back in his chair and rejoiced
that everything was falling into place. Now he needed to cooperate with Arsenal, the prosecutor, and
play along and get a conviction.

*************

In the meantime, Tony had lunch with Angelina and told her he had reservations about Fat Marcus. He
kept thinking that he was not the right choice for a defense attorney. “Look, Tony, you’ve known Fat
Marcus for over twenty years. He will be okay. Do not worry.”

The trial, day one:

Early morning on a Monday in October 2014, Tony and Angelina were getting ready to drive to
downtown Miami to the federal court building. Tony was wearing a navy blue Italian suit with a white
shirt and a red tie, while Angelina was wearing a red dress and high heels. She looked spectacular.
After they cleared the court building’s security checkpoint, they met Fat Marcus on the twelfth floor at
the entrance of courtroom one and entered the large courtroom. “Our table is the one on the left. I will sit
on the aisle, and you, Tony, will sit to my left,” Fat Marcus said.
The prosecutor’s table was on the right, closer to the currently empty jury box. In the center was a dais
were the Honorable Judge Middleton would be presiding. Lower than the judge were two spots for the
clerk of the court and another one for the court reporter. To the left were cases of Marlboros and a big
sign detailing transactions and profits.
Federico Arsenal, the assistant district attorney, was standing by his table. He was thin and
young—mid-thirties—with black hair. He was talking to a lady in her twenties whom Tony assumed was
another assistant attorney; she was short with blonde hair and was wearing a white shirt and a black
skirt. Next to them were Pepe and Renato, the undercover ATF agents.

The clerk of the court stood and said, “Please rise. The Honorable Judge Donald Middleton presides.
This is the case of the United States versus Antony ‘Tony’ Sicily, case number 13- 20570. The defendant
is charged with one count of conspiracy that he believes he was dealing in stolen products.”
The judge, in his mid-sixties with white hair and round spectacles, seemed like a fair man.
Fat Marcus’s performance arguing the motions that Rick the ghostwriter had submitted on his behalf
was terrible. He came across unprepared, to the point that Tony thought him incompetent. His
cross-examination of the government witness was dismal.
Federico Arsenal, on the other hand, was sharp and very well prepared. He played back some of the
recordings of conversations between the confidential informant, the undercover agents, and Tony. Some
statements made by Tony would lead anyone to think he believed the cigarettes were stolen.
After the first day of the trial, Tony was very concerned, and he discussed with Angelina that he wanted
to fire Fat Marcus, but Angelina persuaded him to be more patient.

***********

Day two:

The following morning, on their way to the courthouse, Tony brought up the subject of Fat Marcus, and
again Angelina told him to wait and see.

In the courtroom, Fat Marcus again showed his ignorance of court procedures. He tried to show a
document to the jury that was not in evidence, which Arsenal objected to, and the objection was
sustained by the judge, and once again the judge had to explain to Fat Marcus the proper procedure.
His ability to cross-examine government witnesses lacked substance. He did not know what to ask. With
one particular witness, he asked Tony, “What do I ask her?” and Tony had to tell him.
Witness after witness was more of the same, until Arsenal called Stefano Valerio, Tony’s ex-codefendant
now turned government witness. The fucking rat.
After Valerio had signed an affidavit that Tony was his broker, he changed his story in court and testified
that he told him [A8] the cigarettes were stolen. He even denied knowledge that Tony had refunded
$180,000 that his clerk wired to Tony’s company by mistake, when in reality it was supposed to go to
Renato and Pepe. Tony had wired the money back, no questions asked, when he could have kept it.
That afternoon, Fat Marcus was trying to get Rocco to come over [A9] to answer questions about his
involvement and the kickbacks Tony had given him, but he and his wife were nowhere to be found.
Arsenal rested his case after Valerio had lied through his teeth under oath. Tony needed to do something
to help his case, so he decided to testify.
At around 3:30 p.m., the judge brought the jury back and advised them that the government had rested
its case and the defense was planning to bring a couple of witnesses. Fat Marcus stood and called
Antony Sicily to the witness stand.
Fat Marcus started direct examination, mostly with banal questions about how long Tony had lived in
Miami, who his family was, how long he had known Rocco, how often they played tennis together, and
how long they had done business together.

Once Fat Marcus finished asking questions, Arsenal started his cross-examination. Right away he
started to make Tony look like a liar in front of the jury. “Did I hear you say under oath that you never
heard the phrase ‘fell off the truck’?” Arsenal asked.
“I never heard it,” Tony replied. “Cigarettes don’t fall off the trucks.”
“Did you ever use the phrase ‘I am not snitch’?” Arsenal asked.
“Yes, I have used that phrase,” Tony replied. “Meaning I am a man of integrity.”
“Have you ever been convicted of a crime?” Arsenal asked.
“Yes, I have. Possession of marijuana.”
“And you told Renato Rodriguez that you knew names he could not believe.”
“Yes, I did.”
“Tell me their names. I need to remind you that you are under oath?” Arsenal asked.
“I’m not going to tell you any names,” Tony said. “I was only telling these characters, playing crooked
guys, what they wanted to hear.”
“So, you are not a snitch, but you lie to the jury,” Arsenal said.
“I am not lying to the jury. I never believed the product was stolen. I even asked Pepe, and he said no.”
Tony added, “I always thought the duty of a district attorney was to seek the truth, not to convict an
innocent man.”
“You are not a snitch,” Arsenal said.

*************
Day three—the verdict:
The following morning, Angelina and Tony admitted to each other that the outcome did not look good,
though Angelina thought Tony had come across very well in his testimony. They arrived at the
courtroom, and Tony asked Fat Marcus if Rocco was going to show up.
Marcus assured Tony that he had spoken to Rocco’s attorney and that he was going to show up at nine
o’clock.
After discussing the jury instructions, during which Fat Marcus refused to argue the “buyer and seller
relationship,” which would prove that there was no conspiracy, the government, since it had the burden
of proof, went first with its closing arguments.
Arsenal summarized his case for the jury. He played back snippets of the recorded conversations,
emphasizing Tony’s statements in a way that would lead anyone to believe that he thought the cigarettes
were stolen. He went overboard showing the profits Tony had made in the transactions, and reviewed
Valerio’s testimony as if he had told the truth, all while telling the jury, “He is guilty.”
Fat Marcus went over the fact that Tony was a family man, that he had asked whether the cigarettes
were stolen, and that he was told no by the undercover agent. But all along, his defense approach was
that Tony was Valerio’s broker. Then he told the jury, “Sicily purchased and sold these cigarettes,”
contradicting his whole approach. Tony could not believe that Marcus had thrown him under the bus.
It was almost noon when the jury retired to deliberate. They came back out at 1:30 with the verdict.
“Ladies and gentleman of the jury, have you reached a verdict?” Judge Middleton asked.
“Yes, we have, your honor,” the foreman replied. “We find the defendant, guilty.”

Tony was not surprise by the verdict. Now he was just worried about how much time he would have to
do.

The End

[A1]Unclear. Is this what he told Rocco and Rosario, or is this what he’s asking of Tony now?
[A2]“solo” or “en paz”?
[A3]Over a year since what?
[A4]I don’t think readers will understand what this means.
[A5]Correct?
[A6]It isn’t entirely clear who the “their” “they” and “them” are in this sentence [their personal numbers or

the ATF?], or whether the “he” is Valerio or the truck driver. Please clarify.
[A7]Do you mean “Et tu, Marcus?” referencing “Et tu, Brute?” from Julius Caesar?
[A8]Tony told Valerio, or Valerio told Tony?
[A9]Do you mean to his office, or in the courtroom?
