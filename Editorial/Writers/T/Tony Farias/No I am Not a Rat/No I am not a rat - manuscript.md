Prologue

Tony Sicily, the alarm went off at 6:00 a.m., the sounds of the birds in the backyard. Recently, he had set up a series of bird feeders in his backyard, Woodpeckers knocking on the palm trees, cardinals and Bluejays singing. Even colorful miniature Parrots make a lot of noise. It is a bird paradise.

The business has been very profitable, dealing with Rocco and his Marlboro Cigarettes. Rocco noticed his well-defined abs and reminded himself to stop by the gym. At fifty-five, he could pass for a good-looking man in his mid-forties.

His wife, Angelina, lay sleeping among colorful pillows. The silky sheets had slipped onto the floor, Revealing her naked body. At thirty-seven, she was beautiful with smooth, silky Mediterranean Skin, long black hair, sexy black eyes, and long legs. A great dancer, her early ballet training was prominent.

He stepped into the shower, turned on the hot water, and lathered himself as the aromatic smell of the bath gel filled the air. He came out and shaved himself, then slipped into a fresh pair of boxer shorts, linen shorts, a polo shirt, and brown Sperry top-siders. He combed his hair with his fingers and splashed on some cologne.

“Angelina, are you up?” Tony asked.

She opened her eyes. “Yes, where are you going?”

“I have an early meeting with Rocco at the office. I’ll stop at Versailles for coffee,” Tony replied.

“What time is it?” Angelina asked.

“Almost eight.”

“Oh my God, I have to get up! My Zumba class starts at nine.”

She jumped out of bed and rushed through the bathroom door. She looked back to see if Tony was looking at her. She smiled at him. “Tonight,” she whispered.

The puppy started barking when Tony was on his way to the garage door when the puppy started barking. The buzzer rang; he looked. through the window to his circular driveway and spotted several black cars. Agents in uniform surrounded his black BMW w. AUzi-type submachine gums, a couple of them had their faces covered by ski masks and were wearing bullet-proof vests.

He frowned and shouted through the intercom, “What is happening?”

“This is the ATF,” an agent said. “Open the door.”

Tony opened the door and said, “Do you have a warrant?”

“Tony Sicily, we have a warrant for your arrest. A federal grand jury has issued an indictment.”

“You’ve got to be kidding me. What’s the charge?” Tony asked.

“We can talk about it when we get to headquarters.”

“Are you charging me with a crime?”

“Yes,” the agent replied.

“Then we got nothing to talk about. I want my lawyer to be present if you are asking questions.

The bedroom door swung open, and Angelina appeared, still wrapped in her white velour robe. Her long black hair covered in a towel. She let out a hysterical scream when she spotted the ski-masked agents.

“Tony, what is going on?” she asked.

A taller-than-average agent wearing a ski mask, gun drawn, ready to pull the trigger, looked at her and Said, “Is okay, Señora. Come closer.”

Tony, his hands cuffed behind him, stepped in front of the gun. “That is my wife you’re aiming your gum at. You must go through me first if you plan to pull the trigger.”

“Relax, Tony. We are here to arrest you,” the masked man said.

“Angelina, call Marcus. Tell him some federal agents just arrested,” Tony said. He faced the officers and asked, “Where are you taking me?”

“We are with the ATF and taking you to our headquarters in Doral.”

“The ATF! What is that?” Angelina asked.

“The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives,” an agent replied.

  

Chapter I: The Beginning of The Exodus

 Lukas Dante. He was born in the fishing village of Pachino, Sicily. Lukas was the only child of Angelini Dante and Michaela Fabrici.  His Father and Marcello, his brother,  owned a sizeable Fishing boat. Angelini and Marcello would take the boat out before midnight and sometimes return three weeks later, making stops along the Sicilian coast from Sracusa. The Islands of Malta, Sardinia and Corsica, Ragussa, Pantelleria, Agrigento, Palermo and Messina, selling what they had caught the night before like Prawns, Anchovies, Grouper, local sea bass, sardines, Octopus, clams, anchovies Calamares. 

Occasionally, if they found a deal in Cigarettes, liquors, Wines,  and other delicacies, they would be buy and sell in the next port.

At the time Lukas was 8 years old, tall for his age, blonde hair, green eyes, a good looking kid and always chasing the girls in the village, some said he has taking afters his mothers Michaela, a beautiful blonde whose ancestor had come from Catalunia, Spain.

Angelini was tall and slender, with black hair, black eyes, olive skin, his hand showing the callous of some many years fishing in the region, and strong arms.

  
  
  
  
  
  

 It had been two years since La Revolucion took over the country. Twelve-year-old Tony Sicily was sitting on the steps of his parents’ front porch, observing the traffic of people, beggars, and the injured making their way to the village plaza, where the fiesta in honor of the patron saint the Virgin of Candelaria was being celebrated. It was February 2, 1962.

Maria, Tony’s cousin, had come over from Miami for the celebration. She had moved to Miami about four years earlier on a worker’s contract. She was of medium build, in her mid-thirties. She sat by his side and pulled out a pack of Viceroy American cigarettes.

“May I have one?” Tony asked.

“Tony, if your father’s bus drives by and Alcides sees you smoking, you are going to get in trouble,” she said.

“It’s okay; he knows I smoke. I’ve been smoking American cigarettes since I was eight. I’m twelve now, and I work in the warehouse,” he said. “I want to go to Miami. I don’t like La Revolucion. We cannot get ham, bread, or American cigarettes.”

“What warehouse are you working at?” she asked. “You are just a kid.”

“Sabatez, unloading trucks of detergents.”

“You are not playing baseball anymore?”

“All the time. I go to Cascorro’s poor neighborhood and play con los Negros,” Tony said.

Two months later

Tony found himself on a flight to Miami, trying to remember everything his father and mother had said to him at the Havana airport. I don’t understand why I have to ask for a guy named George—something about Pedro Pam and a camp in Miami, he thought. Why can I not stay with my cousin?

Tony felt warm under the sweater his mother had made him wear. He tilted his Panama hat and asked the steward for a cold Coca-Cola. The pilot was announcing their approach to Miami.

After the plane landed, he stood up and walked slowly toward the staircase, let the air out of his lungs, and wondered about his future in Miami. As he went through Customs, Tony started asking everyone, “Are you George?” Finally, a man in his mid-forties, medium build, and brown hair stopped him and asked, “Estas solo?”

“Si, usted es George?” Tony asked.

“Ven conmigo, nos vamos a reunir co los otros,” he said.

Tony and George approached an elderly man standing by a van with another six kids of different ages.

“Brother Pedro, this is the last flight today. We can go to the camp,” George said.

Tony got in the van and started to introduce himself to the group. They all were scared. The van pulled away from the airport and drove for almost an hour.

The camp consisted of several one-story buildings and a basketball court next to a baseball field. They got out at the main building, and Brother Pedro said, “Come, children, we have some milk and sandwiches for you.” They entered the reception area, and there it was: a cigarette vending machine. Tony smiled—he had a feeling he was going to like this place.

One year later 

Life at the camp was very busy. The boys had school in the morning with the Marist brothers, who also had a school in Havana, and in the afternoons, they played basketball or baseball.

The basketball coach held tryouts for a thirteen-and-under team, and Tony made the cut. He had a great game against a visiting team from the city.

On weekends, the Marist Brothers would bus a group of kids to Miami Beach to swim in the ocean and have a picnic. On one of those outings, Tony met his first love in Miami. While walking along the shore, he spotted a beautiful girl swimming near the shoreline. She called to him and asked him to swim with her. She was almost as tall as Tony, with blonde hair, the most beautiful blue eyes he had ever seen, and long legs. She was wearing a bikini.

“What’s your name?” she asked.

“I’m Tony. And you?”

“My name is Virginia,” she said while getting close to him and starting to touch him. She pulled his swimming shorts down and grabbed him. “Oh, wow,” she said.

She lowered her bikini and straddled him until they joined together. “Oh, Tony, you feel so big.” In that moment, Tony knew that he was going to be addicted to that feeling forever.

  

Chapter II

January 2000

Tony was wondering what his business was going to be like, now that the federal government had passed a law making the sale of “gray-market” premium cigarettes illegal. He was representing manufacturers and importers of low-cost generic-value cigarette brands.

The morning had been hectic, with calls from customers all over the country wanting to order Marlboro cigarettes, which were no longer available. He repeated the same pitch over and over: The gray market was done.

His office consisted of two rooms: a reception area with a desk and a fax-copy machine in one corner, and his private office with a cherry-wood desk, a network telephone, a computer monitor, a credenza on the back wall that he used as a bar, and pictures on the wall of different spectacular views of golf courses.

Tony wandered through his office and down the second-floor hall toward the main office of the bonded/domestic warehouse of the importer with whom he placed most of his orders.

The receptionist, a knock-out blonde, was shuffling some invoices.

“Is Alfredo in his office?” Tony asked her.

“He is on the phone,” she replied.

Tony walked toward the copier and glanced into Alfredo’s assistant’s office. Chiriana winked at him as she got up and approached the copier. She was wearing a Diane Von Furstenberg wraparound dress. She had a full figure and long black hair, was showing a little cleavage, and had a fire in her eyes.

“C’mon, Tony, I got to make some copies,” she said while rubbing her magnificent breasts teasingly against his arms. “Same place at five-thirty,” she whispered.

He winked, acknowledging the date.

A voice sounded from Alfredo’s office. “Chiriana, will you come to my office?” he asked.

She smiled. “Coming!”

As Tony arrived at his office the following morning, his mind wandered into last evening’s episode. It was explosive!

His cell phone rang.

“Hello, this is Tony.”

 “Tony, I didn’t see you at the gym last night,” Alfredo said. “The basketball courts were jammed. I needed you on my team. Where were you?”

Tony paused. “I had a meeting in Fort Lauderdale, trying to push Optimum to a customer. The customers are telling me to get back to them when the 100s are in.”

“I placed the order with the factory. The 100s will be here in three weeks,” Alfredo said.

“I need to call you back. I’m getting a call from Ohio.”

  

Chapter III

The Rats

“Hi, Rob. I was on the phone when your call came in. What’s up?” Tony asked.

“Hi, Tony. We just had a meeting with a couple of guys from Miami. They want us to pick up their brand Maxxon, manufactured in Paraguay.”

“Who are they?”

“Rocco and Rosario,” Rob said. “They said that Mark gave them a $100,000 deposit for 10,000 master cases, sixty cartons to a case, and asked us to wire the balance: $4.5 million.”

“Wow, that’s 600,000 cartons if I’m doing the math correctly. That comes out to $7.50 per carton, which is over a dollar above market value,” Tony said. “Has Mark gone loco or what?”

“Tony, we could move the cigarettes at the right price, one truckload at a time. We are not going to pay in advance. Do you know these guys?” Rob asked.

“No, I never heard of them. I’ll ask around.”

“We told them that you handle all our purchases out of Miami and that you are our broker; so please establish the right price, and we will send you the money to pay for the truckload when we need them[A1] ,” Rob said.

“Did you get their number?” Tony asked.

“No, I don’t want to deal with this. I gave them your number,” Rob said.

“Okay, I will handle them,” Tony said.

Tony paused for a second, picked up his office phone, and dialed Alfredo’s extension.

“Alfredo, do you know these importers Rocco and Rosario?” Tony asked.

There was silence on the other end of the line. Finally, Alfredo said, “Yes, I know them. Why?”

“They met one of my customers in Ohio and tried to push their brand, Maxxon, made in Paraguay. Rob told them to come see me since I’m their broker down here.”

“Tony, keep this in mind: These Rocco and Rosario are not to be trusted. Never wire funds in advance to them! Are you going to the gym later?”

“No, I have a late meeting. Then I’m taking Angelina out to dinner,” Tony replied. He thought, Well, according to Alfredo, he had to be extremely careful with these guys.

  

Chapter IV

Port Everglades, Fort Lauderdale, Florida

It was Friday afternoon in January, and the weather in Miami was spectacular: seventy-two degrees, not a cloud in the sky. Tony called Caffe Abbracci, an Italian eatery in Coral Gables, and made a reservation for two at 8 p.m.

“Angelina, I made a reservation at Caffe Abbracci for eight o’clock,” Tony said. “I have a meeting in Port Everglades, so I’ll meet you there.”

“Okay, darling. Don’t be late. You know when I sit alone in a bar, all the men start buzzing around me like flies,” Angelina said.

“If anyone bothers you, tell Benedetto, the owner. He’s a good friend.”

Tony arrived at Port Everglades, got clearance at the checkpoint, and drove to John Baldovino’s warehouse. He went up the steps to the office and knocked on the door. John’s deep voice welcomed him in. Inside were two old wooden desks. Beside the computer monitor on the desk on the right was a rotary phone; beyond that, a metal cabinet showing signs of rust.

“Buona sera John, come stai?” Tony asked.

“Benne, grazie, e tu?” John replied.

“Abbastanza bene, grazie. Were you able to get rid of all your premium cigarettes?”

“Yeah. Sold everything I had before the dateline,” he said. “I am trying to manufacture a brand in Paraguay. That is the next segment of the business that will be taking off—value brands.”

“There are a couple of guys who had a brand made in Paraguay, Rocco and Rosario. Do you know them?” Tony asked.

“Yeah, I know them,” John said. “As a matter of fact, I talked with them about making my brand. Why do you ask?”

“They went to see one of my customers in Ohio. The client asked me to broker the transactions. Are these guys trustworthy?”

“A couple of rats. I wouldn’t wire money in advance to them,” John said.

“Do you know their full names and their company name?” Tony asked.

“Rogelio ‘Rocco’ Vacca and Rosario Eacobacci. Their company is Gulfstream something.”

“Okay, thanks. John, let me know when you bring your value brand. I have customers all over the country.”

“I know. Ciao, grazie.”

While driving to Coral Gables to meet Angelina, Tony started thinking about these Rocco and Rosario people. What did John call them? A pair of rats? It was clear that he needed to be extra careful with this duo.

  

Chapter V

The black BMW pulled up in front of the restaurant. The valet, a slender young man wearing a red shirt and black pants, greeted him by name. “Welcome, Mr. Sicily. It is nice to see you again. I will leave your car in front.”

“Thank you, Pablo,” Tony said. “Bring my wife’s Mercedes up front as well.”

Entering through the double doors, Tony smiled to the beautiful young hostess, a stunning blonde in her early twenties with blue eyes and a butt that would stop traffic on a crowded street.

“Good evening, Marisela. As beautiful as ever. How are you?” Tony asked.

“Mr. Sicily, you are always so gallant. I bet you say that to every woman,” Marisela said. “I am very well, thank you. And how you are?”

“I say that only to the pretty ones, Marisela. I am fine, grazie,” Tony said, smiling.

The reception area was a cozy room. Candles lit up a Victorian couch and two armchairs in a corner. A small lamp illuminated the reservation book on the dark wood lectern.

The deep voice of Benedetto, the owner, sounded. “Buona sera, signore Sicily. Come stai?”

“Non c’e male, il mio amico. Stai tenendo d’occhio mia moglie?” Tony asked.

“Si, lei e al bar.”

“Grazie. La tabella usual, per favore.”

Tony entered the bar area. It was dark, with several small tables to the right by the windows overlooking Giralda Street, several ladies sitting on bar stools around them. He noticed that a couple of guys were trying to talk to Angelina. She saw him and got up from the bar stool. She looked spectacular in a short red dress, with deep cleavage enhancing her full breasts. She could pass for a supermodel.

“Tony! Que bueno que llegastes. Ese par de moscones no me dejavan tranquila[A2] ,” she said and kissed him on the lips.

“Angelina, amore, you look amazing.” Tony said. “Benedetto is getting our table ready. How about another drink?”

“Si mi amor.”

Tony glanced at the bartender. Luca was serving two ladies at the corner of the bar. He spotted Tony and came over, smiling.

“Buona sera Luca. Come va?” Tony asked.

“Bene, grazie. E lei?” Luca replied.

“Abbastanza bene, grazie. Un cosmopolita per il ladie, e il solito black label sulle rocce.”

“How was your meeting?” Angelina asked.

“It went well,” Tony said.

Marisela approach them at the bar and said, “Mr. and Mrs. Sicily, your table is ready. Your drinks will be taken to your table. Please follow me.”

Tony left a twenty-dollar bill on the bar and followed Marisela and Angelina to the main dining room. They were walking side by side; he looked at their legs, raised his eyes to their butts, and smiled. After a pause, he noticed both of them watching him out of the corner of their eyes while flicking their hair with their hands. This must be a symbol of an animal sexual attraction between a man and a woman, he thought.

The dining room was spacious, with two rows of square tables separated by a row of round, larger tables in the middle. The tables were covered with white linen cloths and napkins, wine and water glasses, and shining silverware. On the walls hung pictures of celebrities—Marciano, Frank, Dino, Grace, Rita. At their usual table on the corner, Marisela placed a leather-bound menu in front of Angelina and two menus in front of Tony.

“Thank you, grazie, Marisela,” Tony said.

“Prego,” she replied.

The maître d’ approached the table and greeted them. “Buona sera, Mr. and Mrs. Sicily. Benbenutti a Caffe Abbracci. Here are your drinks. Will you be ordering wine for dinner?”

“Si, per favore. Una Bottiglia di Casanova Di Neri, Brunello. And for dinner, I will start with a small Caesar salad with anchovies, and the lady will have fettuccine dolce vita, and I will have veal marsala. Grazie, Paolo,” Tony said.

“Molto bene sinore Sicily,” Paolo said.

Later that evening …
