# Chapter 1
In the heart of 1962, amidst the swirling winds of La Revolucion, Tony Sicily, a spirited twelve-year-old, finds himself on the cusp of adolescence and political upheaval. Seated on the worn steps of his family's modest home, Tony's gaze sweeps across the vibrant tapestry of village life unfolding before him. The bustling plaza, alive with the preparations for the fiesta in honor of the Virgin of Candelaria, serves as a pulsating center where tradition and transformation collide. 

The plaza is a canvas of motion and color, animated by the bustling preparations of vendors who line the cobblestone streets with their makeshift stalls. The air, heavy with anticipation for the evening's festivities, is infused with the tantalizing scents of local cuisine that drift through the crowd, a savory invitation to indulge in the island's rich culinary traditions. Smoky whispers from grilled seafood mix with the sweet allure of fried pastries, creating an olfactory tapestry that weaves through the gathering throng. Children, embodying the unrestrained joy of the occasion, weave nimbly between clusters of conversing adults. Their laughter rings out, a spontaneous melody that lifts the spirits of all it touches, igniting smiles even on the most weathered faces. They play impromptu games of chase, their energy boundless, their brightly colored clothing blurring into streaks of light as they move. Amidst this vibrant chaos, the village elders form small islands of calm. Seated on worn benches or leaning against the sun-warmed walls, they observe the scene with eyes that have witnessed the passage of many such festivals. Their conversations, rich with the timbre of experience, are punctuated by hearty laughs and thoughtful nods. They share stories of fiestas past, each tale a thread in the intricate tapestry of the community's shared history. Their voices, carrying the weight of years, blend nostalgia for times gone by with a resilient hope for the future, offering a poignant contrast to the carefree exuberance of the youth around them.

This tableau of generational interplay, set against the backdrop of the fiesta's preparations, captures the essence of the community's spirit. It is a moment suspended in time, where the past and the present merge, held together by the anticipation of shared celebration and the enduring bonds of island heritage.

Maria, Tony’s cousin, emerges as a bridge between two worlds. Having left for Miami four years prior, her return is a living testament to the diaspora shaped by economic necessity and the lure of the American dream. Her presence at the fiesta, marked by her modern attire and tales of life in the United States, introduces a juxtaposition of cultures and aspirations, igniting Tony’s imagination and planting seeds of wanderlust.

As the sun dips lower, casting long shadows over the plaza, the community gathers in earnest, united in celebration yet divided in their dreams for the future. The fiesta, with its traditional music, dance, and offerings, becomes a sanctuary of shared heritage, a momentary respite from the uncertainties that lay beyond the village borders. For Tony, perched on the threshold of youth and adulthood, the fiesta is a kaleidoscope of sights, sounds, and emotions. It is a poignant reminder of the ties that bind him to his roots and the forces of change propelling him toward an unknown destiny. As he absorbs the spectacle, the essence of his village, with its enduring spirit and evolving dreams, etches itself into his memory, shaping the man he is destined to become.

Maria brought with her whispers of a different existence, encapsulated in the simple act of sharing a pack of Viceroy American cigarettes with Tony. Her presence, a blend of the familiar and the exotic, offered Tony a glimpse into a realm of possibilities, far removed from the revolution's shadows.

“May I have one?” Tony asked.

“Tony, if your father’s bus drives by and Alfonso sees you smoking, you are going to get in trouble,” she said.

“It’s okay; he knows I smoke. I’ve been smoking American cigarettes since I was eight. I’m twelve now, and I work in the warehouse,” he said. “I want to go to Miami. I don’t like La Revolucion. We cannot get ham, bread, or American cigarettes.”

“What warehouse are you working at?” she asked. “You are just a kid.”

“Sabatez, unloading trucks of detergents.”

“You are not playing baseball anymore?”

“All the time. I go to Cascorro’s poor neighborhood and play con los Negros,” Tony said.
