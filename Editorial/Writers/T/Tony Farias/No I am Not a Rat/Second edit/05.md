# Chapter 5
"Hey, Rob. Caught your call just as I was wrapping up another. What's the situation?" Tony's voice, steady and composed, inquires through the phone, his gaze momentarily drifting towards the cityscape beyond his office window, where the early morning light begins to unveil the day's potential.

"Morning, Tony. We've just wrapped a discussion with a duo from Miami, Rocco and Rosario. They're pitching us to distribute Maxxon, a brand out of Paraguay," Rob's voice comes through the line, clear and somewhat intrigued by the new prospect.

"And who exactly are these guys?" Tony leans back in his chair, the leather creaking under his weight, his mind already turning the gears, assessing the implications of this new deal.

"Rocco and Rosario," Rob repeats, a hint of caution threading through his tone. "They've secured a $100,000 deposit from Mark for 10,000 master cases, each with sixty cartons, and now they're looking for us to transfer the remaining $4.5 million."

Tony's fingers tap a rhythmic beat on his desk as he quickly calculates the numbers. "That's 600,000 cartons, hitting us at $7.50 each. We're talking a markup of over a dollar per carton from the usual rate. Has Mark lost his senses?" His question, half rhetorical, hangs in the air, a cloud of disbelief mingling with concern.

"Look, Tony, at a competitive price, we can offload these cigarettes, truck by truck. But fronting the cash? That's not happening. Ever heard of these fellows?" Rob's query underlines the precariousness of the proposition.

"They're news to me. I'll dig around." Tony's reply is swift, a promise of due diligence in the face of uncertainty.

"We've directed them your way, mentioning you're our go-to guy in Miami for purchases. So, you're on point to negotiate a fair price, and we'll forward payment per truckload as needed," Rob outlines the plan, setting the stage for Tony's involvement.

"Did they leave a contact?" The question slips from Tony's lips as he starts to piece together his approach.

"No, I've passed your details instead. I'd rather not get involved," Rob's admission carries a weight, a subtle handoff of responsibility.

"Alright, I'll take it from here," Tony assures, a mix of resolve and caution coloring his tone.

A brief pause follows, the line humming softly, before Tony bridges the gap to his next call. "Alfredo, ever come across importers named Rocco and Rosario?" His inquiry to Alfredo is direct, seeking insight from a trusted source.

A moment of silence lingers, almost tangible, before Alfredo's voice cuts through, seasoned with knowledge and a hint of warning. "Yes, I'm familiar. What's up?"

"They've approached a client in Ohio with their Maxxon cigarettes from Paraguay, telling them I'm the broker here. What's your take?" Tony's question, laden with the weight of potential decisions, seeks more than informationâ€”it seeks guidance.

Alfredo's advice is clear, a beacon in the murky waters of business dealings. "Tony, tread carefully. Rocco and Rosario are bad news. Never send money upfront. You hitting the gym later?"

"Not tonight. Got a late meeting, then dinner plans with Angelina," Tony replies, his thoughts momentarily drifting to the evening ahead, even as he mentally notes Alfredo's warning about the dubious duo. The conversation closes, leaving Tony to navigate the intricate dance of risk and opportunity that defines his world.
