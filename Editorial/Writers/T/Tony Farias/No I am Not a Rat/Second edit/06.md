# Chapter 6
Miami was basking in the kind of idyllic weather that postcards are made of—a balmy seventy-two degrees that felt like nature's own embrace. The sky stretched out in a vast expanse of unblemished azure, setting a picturesque backdrop for the day's unfolding events. It was the kind of day that called for making the most of every moment, and Tony was intent on doing just that. With a sense of purpose, he reached for his phone and dialed Caffe Abbracci, a beloved Italian bistro that held a special place in his heart. Nestled in the vibrant enclave of Coral Gables, the restaurant was known for its exquisite cuisine and warm, inviting ambiance—a slice of Italy in the heart of Miami. The familiar voice on the other end of the line greeted him, and within moments, Tony had secured a reservation for two at 8 p.m., a perfect setting for an evening of culinary delight.

Turning to Angelina, he shared the plans with a smile. "Angelina, we're set for dinner at Caffe Abbracci, eight sharp." His voice carried a hint of excitement, anticipating the evening ahead. "I've got business at Port Everglades, but I'll head straight there afterward," he added, mapping out his schedule with precision.

Angelina's response was tinged with playful caution, "Just make sure you're on time. You know how it is—sitting solo at the bar makes me a magnet for unwanted attention." Her words danced between jest and genuine concern, a reminder of the evenings spent waiting, albeit briefly, for Tony's arrival.

Tony's assurance was swift and sincere. "Should that happen, just let Benedetto know. He'll look out for you; he's a pal." His confidence in Benedetto, the restaurant's proprietor and a friend, was unwavering—a testament to the bonds forged over countless shared meals and memories within the bistro's welcoming walls.

As Tony set off for his engagement at Port Everglades, the promise of the evening's rendezvous at Caffe Abbracci lingered in his mind. The hustle of the port, with its towering cranes and endless rows of containers, would soon give way to the intimate glow of the bistro, where he and Angelina would unwind in the company of good food and each other. Miami, with its ever-changing tapestry of work and leisure, provided the perfect backdrop for their life's shared moments, each one savored like a fine wine.

As Tony's car approached the sprawling complex of Port Everglades, he navigated through the maze of shipping containers and towering cranes that dominated the landscape. The port, a bustling hub of international commerce, pulsed with the rhythm of unending activity. Tony's familiarity with this environment allowed him to effortlessly pass through the security checkpoint, exchanging brief pleasantries with the guards who recognized him from his frequent visits.

The air was thick with the scent of salt and diesel, a reminder of the port's ceaseless connection to distant shores. Tony parked his car and stepped out, the sound of his footsteps mingling with the distant calls of seagulls and the low hum of machinery. He made his way towards John Baldovino's warehouse, a structure that stood apart from its surroundings, not by its size but by the stories it held within its walls.

Ascending the concrete steps to the office, Tony felt a sense of anticipation. He rapped on the weathered wooden door, its surface bearing the marks of countless such knocks. The door swung open to reveal John Baldovino, his presence as commanding as the warehouse he operated. John's greeting was robust, a reflection of his personality and the camaraderie he shared with Tony. Stepping into the office, Tony was immediately enveloped in an atmosphere that spoke of a bygone era. The room was dominated by two aged wooden desks that had clearly seen decades of use. Each desk told its own story, its surface scarred with the indentations and stains of relentless paperwork and negotiations. Beside one of the desks sat a rotary phone, its presence a quaint reminder of the past, juxtaposed oddly next to a modern computer monitor that flickered with the day's logistics and communications.

Against one wall stood a metal cabinet, its once-shiny surface now dulled and etched with patches of rust. This cabinet, much like the rest of the office, was a testament to the enduring nature of John's operations, a symbol of resilience in the face of time and change.

The office, with its mix of antiquated charm and functional clutter, served as a sanctuary from the hustle of the port outside. It was a place where deals were made, where the complexities of global trade were distilled into the straightforward language of business. For Tony, stepping into this space was a step into a realm where the past and present converged, where the pulse of international commerce was tempered by the enduring bonds of friendship and trust.

"Good evening, John. How's life treating you?" Tony greeted in Italian.

"All good, thanks. And yourself?" John responded.

"Not too bad, thanks. Managed to offload all your premium stock before the deadline?" Tony inquired.

"Absolutely. Cleared out everything. Now, I'm eyeing a venture into manufacturing in Paraguay—aiming at the value brand market," John disclosed.

"Speaking of Paraguay, heard of Rocco and Rosario? They're pushing a brand there," Tony probed.

"Yeah, I've crossed paths with them. Even discussed launching my own brand. What's your interest?" John inquired.

"They approached a client of mine in Ohio. Looks like I'm brokering their deal. Got any insights on their credibility?" Tony pressed.

"Steer clear. Those two are nothing but trouble. I wouldn't send a dime ahead," John cautioned.

"Got any more details on them? Names, company?" Tony sought further.

"Rogelio 'Rocco' Vacca and Rosario Eacobacci. Run something called Gulfstream, if memory serves," John provided.

"Thanks, John. Let me know when you're ready to market your value brand. I've got a network ready," Tony offered.

"Will do. Take care, and thanks," John concluded.

As Tony drove towards Coral Gables, his mind lingered on John's words. 'A pair of rats,' was it? This bit of intel painted a clear picture: dealing with Rocco and Rosario demanded caution.
