# Chapter 8
The first light of dawn had barely begun to seep through the curtains when Tony embarked on his morning ritual, a blend of quiet contemplation and the day's initial stirrings. His routine, a carefully curated sequence of small tasks designed to set the tone for the day ahead, moved seamlessly from a solitary cup of coffee savored in the hush of the early hours, to the methodical review of his schedule, each activity lending a sense of order and purpose.

However, this particular morning's tranquility was abruptly pierced by the insistent ring of his phone, a sound that seemed out of place amidst the otherwise serene start to the day. The sharp trill echoed through the room, pulling Tony's attention away from his thoughts and towards the device that lay on the kitchen counter, its screen aglow with the indication of an incoming call.

With a resigned sigh, Tony crossed the room, the soft sounds of his footsteps on the tiled floor barely audible above the persistent ringing. He reached for the phone, the cool surface of the screen contrasting with the warmth of his palm. A glance at the caller ID confirmed that the day's business was beginning earlier than anticipated, a reminder of the unpredictable rhythm that often underscored his professional life.

Lifting the phone to his ear, Tony answered with a practiced greeting, his voice steady despite the unexpected disruption. The call, while an interruption to his morning's calm, was also a tether to the world beyond his doorstep, a world where decisions awaited and the tempo of life moved with relentless urgency.

As he engaged with the caller, Tony's gaze drifted towards the window, where the morning light continued its slow advance, painting the room with hues of gold and amber. The contrast between the tranquility of the dawn and the immediacy of the conversation was stark, a reminder of the balance between the personal and professional that Tony navigated daily. With the call concluded, he placed the phone back on the counter, the silence of the room returning as he resumed his morning routine, albeit with the day's first challenge already set in motion.

"Tony, Rocco here. Rob passed along your contact. We need to discuss business."

"Morning, Rocco. Sure, my office could work. It's in the same complex as Alfredo's place," Tony offered.

Rocco, pausing, decided on a different venue. "How about Houston's in Coral Gables for lunch?"

"1 p.m. works for me," Tony agreed, a hint of caution in his voice. He wondered about Rocco's reluctance to meet near Alfredo's, a thought that lingered as he prepared for the day.

Houston's, nestled in the heart of Coral Gables, was a sanctuary of culinary delight and quiet conversation amidst the city's lively pace. Its reputation for quality dining and the unique layout that offered pockets of privacy made it the chosen venue for Tony's crucial meeting. The restaurant's interior, with its warm lighting and rich wood accents, created an inviting atmosphere that contrasted with the sharp matters at hand.

Tony arrived ahead of time, a strategic choice that allowed him to absorb the environment and prepare mentally. He claimed a spot at the bar, a vantage point that afforded him a clear view of the entrance. With a drink in hand, he presented an image of relaxed anticipation, though his eyes betrayed his keen vigilance, darting towards the door with each new arrival.

The moment Rocco and his companion stepped through the door, they were a study in contrast to the restaurant's other patrons. Their entrance was marked not just by their appearance, which aligned with Alfredo's description, but by the subtle shift in the air, a tension that seemed to follow them. Tony's greeting was cordial yet measured, the initial pleasantries quickly giving way to the matter at hand.

A hostess, sensing the need for discretion, promptly guided them to a secluded booth, a haven within Houston's where conversations could unfold away from prying ears. The booth, enveloped in the soft glow of overhead lighting, became the stage for their negotiation.

Rocco wasted no time in laying out the expectations for their brand Maxxon, his words heavy with the anticipation of a lucrative deal stretching across Ohio and Northern Indiana. Tony, however, was undeterred by the figures thrown around, his response laying out clear terms for proceeding. The conversation that followed saw Tony advocating for a cautious approach, emphasizing the need for product verification and a more reasonable pricing strategy.

Rocco's reaction to Tony's conditions was immediate and visible, his agitation surfacing like ripples on water. However, Rosario's presence served as a counterbalance, his subtle gesture a silent call for composure.

"Monday at 10, then. We'll review the stock in the Free Zone," Tony steered the conversation towards a conclusion, setting the stage for a detailed examination of the goods. This agreement, while tentative, marked a significant step in their negotiation, a bridge over the chasm of their differing expectations.

As they parted ways, the air between them was charged with unspoken tensions and the weight of future dealings. Rocco's parting words, though meant for Rosario, carried a thinly veiled warning, a reminder of the stakes involved. Tony, left to ponder the encounter, was acutely aware of the delicate balance he navigatedâ€”a dance on the edge of opportunity and risk, set against the backdrop of Houston's subdued elegance.
