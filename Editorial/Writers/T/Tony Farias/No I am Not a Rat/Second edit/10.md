# Chapter 10
The rhythm of Tony's business had slowed to a quiet murmur, a stark contrast to the bustling activity it once knew. The days were filled with attempts to navigate the changing tides of the tobacco industry, a challenge magnified by the increasing number of local brands falling out of favor across several states. Their failure to contribute to the master settlement agreement had led to their exclusion, leaving Tony in search of new avenues to invigorate his product lineup.

In this period of recalibration, the sudden ring of his phone cut through the silence of his office like a beacon, breaking the monotony of his thoughts.

"Hey Tony, it's Rocco. How's it going? Listen, I've got a friend visiting with his girlfriend, and they're itching for a game of tennis. You in?" Rocco's voice carried an easy camaraderie, a reminder of the world beyond Tony's current preoccupations.

"Sure, I'm up for it. Where are we playing? Just a heads up, I might be a bit out of practice," Tony replied, the prospect of a leisurely diversion from his concerns a welcome one.

"We'll hit the courts at the Biltmore. After, we can catch up over drinks. My friend's got some products that could interest you," Rocco mentioned, weaving business into the casual invitation with the skill of a seasoned player in their shared games of profit and opportunity.

The Biltmore Tennis Center, with its pristine courts and lush surroundings, provided a perfect backdrop for their meeting. Tony was introduced to Renato and Ashley upon his arrival. Renato, a compact figure with an intensity that belied his stature, was Rocco's tennis partner, while Ashley, pairing with Tony, boasted an athletic grace and a presence that was both striking and disarming.

After the game, which offered both competition and camaraderie, they retreated to the hotel's bar, a space of refined comfort where they could relax and delve into the heart of Rocco's hinted proposition.

"So, Renato, where's home for you?" Tony ventured, seeking to bridge the gap between casual acquaintance and potential business ally.

"Originally from the Dominican Republic, but I've spent most of my life in New York," Renato shared, his story opening a window into his world. "Actually, I was wondering if you have any connections with the Native American tribes upstate?"

"I do, actually. What's on your mind?" Tony's interest was piqued, sensing the undercurrents of a business opportunity amidst their casual banter.

"We've got access to Marlboros," Renato hinted, his words hanging in the air with the promise of untold profits.

Rocco chimed in, eager to underscore the potential of the venture. "This could be huge for you, Tony. Truckloads of product."

The mention of Marlboros stirred a mix of interest and caution in Tony. "Selling gray-market Marlboros isn't exactly legal," he noted, the weight of legal scrutiny never far from his mind.

"These aren't gray-market; they're legit, straight from Philip Morris," Rocco clarified, keen to allay Tony's concerns.

"And how did you come by them?" Tony probed further, his instincts honed by years in a business where the lines between opportunity and risk were often blurred.

"Best you don't know," Renato suggested, a hint of mystery clouding the offer.

After a moment of consideration, Tony decided, "I'll have to pass. I'm actually on the lookout for a solid value brand for the tribes. Anyway, I'm off to a trade show in Vegas tomorrow. Wish you all the best."

As Tony excused himself from the gathering, the remaining trio lingered at the bar, their conversation turning towards the next steps of their plan.

"Tony's no fool. We've got to tread lightly here," Renato cautioned, aware of the delicate balance they needed to maintain.

Ashley, her thoughts momentarily drifting towards Tony's departure, remarked, "He's quite the looker, isn't he?"

But Rocco's mind was already racing ahead, fixated on the endgame. "It's money he's after. He'll bite eventually," he mused, confident in their ability to entice Tony into their web of commerce and intrigue.
