As he made his way toward the taxi queue, the distinctive buzz of his phone cut through the din of the crowded airport. Pulling the device from his pocket, he saw Mark's name flash across the screen.

"Hey, Tony, you've touched down in Vegas?" Mark's voice came through, a mix of eagerness and camaraderie.

"Yes, I'm here. Just landed. What about you?" Tony responded, his voice carrying a blend of fatigue from the flight and the burgeoning excitement for what lay ahead.

The call, brief yet filled with the promise of collaboration and shared ventures, was a fitting start to Tony's Las Vegas journey. As he queued for a taxi, the dazzling skyline of the city loomed in the distance, a beacon drawing him into its whirlwind of opportunities and challenges. This trip was more than just a business endeavor; it was a foray into the heart of an industry that thrived on innovation and negotiation, a chance to secure his place in the ever-evolving tapestry of the tobacco market.

"Yeah, just got here. How about you?" Tony replied.

"I'm over at the Mandalay Bay. You?"

"The Hilton for me. Is Rob with you?"

"No, he's back in Florida," Mark answered.

"Alright, I'm off to catch some sleep. We'll catch up later," Tony said, planning a brief respite.

Tony, standing amidst the bustling energy of Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport, patiently waited in the taxi queue, his eyes taking in the sea of faces around him. Each person was a story, a visitor drawn to the city's infamous allure, seeking fortunes, fun, or escape. When his turn came, Tony slid into the back seat of a waiting taxi, the vehicle's air-conditioned interior a welcome reprieve from the Nevada heat that radiated off the tarmac.

The drive from the airport to the Las Vegas Hilton was a visual symphony of the city's vibrant life. Neon signs blinked their endless invitations, while the streets thronged with people from all walks of life. The cityscape was a mosaic of iconic casinos, towering hotels, and endless entertainment venues, each vying for attention under the expansive desert sky. Tony watched the spectacle through the window, his mind on the impending trade show, yet momentarily captivated by the city's unique energy.

Upon arrival at the Las Vegas Hilton, Tony was greeted by the grandeur befitting one of the city's notable accommodations. The lobby was a bustling hub of activity, its decor an elegant testament to Las Vegas's blend of luxury and excitement. Navigating through the throngs of guests and the soft din of slot machines located in the lobby's corners, Tony approached the check-in desk. The process was swift, a testament to the efficiency and hospitality that the hotel prided itself on. With key card in hand, Tony made his way to his room, eager for a moment of solitude after the day's journey.

The room was an oasis of comfort, its layout and furnishings designed to offer sanctuary and luxury in equal measure. The king-size bed, with its plush bedding and an array of pillows, promised rest and rejuvenation. But before succumbing to the bed's inviting embrace, Tony headed straight for the shower. The water, warm and refreshing, washed away the remnants of his travel, leaving him revitalized and clear-headed.

Wrapped in the soft fabric of a hotel bathrobe, Tony allowed himself a brief moment of relaxation on the bed. The comfort of the mattress and the quiet of the room were a stark contrast to the bustling activity that awaited him at the trade show. It was a moment of peace, a brief interlude before immersing himself in the business and networking that the trip necessitated.

However, this tranquil moment was short-lived. The ring of his phone pierced the silence, a reminder of the world beyond his temporary haven. With a sigh, Tony reached for the device, ready to pivot back to the demands of his profession. The call, another link in the chain of his business endeavors, was a signal that the trade show's whirlwind of opportunities, challenges, and potential deals was about to begin.

"Tony, it's Rocco. You meeting with Mark in Vegas?"

"Yeah, planning on it. What's it about?"

"Those Marlboros, think Mark's interested?"

"Doubtful. His folks deal directly for Marlboros."

"And the tribes?"

"I'll see."
