# Chapter 12

The sun rose over Las Vegas, casting a golden hue across the city, signaling the start of a new day filled with potential and promise for Tony. With the trade show's badge securely in his grasp, he made his way towards the bustling convention center, a melting pot of industry professionals from across the globe. The air was electric with anticipation, the throngs of attendees moving with a purpose, each individual a story, a mission, a goal.

As Tony moved through the sprawling event, his eyes were drawn to the diverse array of participants that filled the room. Each booth was a microcosm of the broader tobacco industry, showcasing innovations, traditions, and the latest market trends. The representatives behind each counter were as varied as the products they showcased, their pitches polished, their smiles welcoming.

Among the sea of faces, one individual stood out to Tony, capturing his attention with an allure that was both striking and serene. She stood at her booth with a grace that seemed to transcend the commercial hustle surrounding her. Of medium build, her presence was accentuated by her dark brown hair, which cascaded softly around her shoulders, framing a face highlighted by vivid green eyes. Her mixed heritage lent her features an exotic beauty, a blend of cultures and stories embodied in a single glance.

Compelled by a mixture of professional curiosity and personal intrigue, Tony approached her, his seasoned confidence as a businessman tempered by the genuine admiration he felt. "Morning," he began, his voice carrying a mix of respect and charm, "you're easily the highlight of the show."

"Thanks, that's sweet of you," she replied, scanning his badge. "And where might you be from with such charm?"

"Jamaica. And you? Italian roots?"

"Cuban-born, but Italian blood runs through me. How about we grab a drink after this wraps up?"

She pondered, then offered, "I'm free after five."
