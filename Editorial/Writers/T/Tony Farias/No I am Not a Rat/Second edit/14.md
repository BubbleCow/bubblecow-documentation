# Chapter 14
In the heart of Coral Gables, a neighborhood known for its lush Mediterranean-style landscapes and grandiose homes, Rocco's residence stood out as a testament to success, albeit of a dubious nature. The sprawling estate, ensconced in a tapestry of meticulously manicured gardens and towering palm trees, offered a serene fa√ßade that belied the intensity of the discussions taking place within.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows and bathing the estate in a warm, golden glow, the interior of Rocco's home buzzed with a different kind of energy. The living room, a spacious area adorned with opulent furnishings and rich, dark wood accents, had been transformed into a makeshift war room. Here, Rocco, Renato, and Rosario gathered around a large, antique mahogany table that dominated the space, its surface cluttered with laptops, documents, and several cups of strong, black coffee.

The atmosphere was charged, a mix of tension and focus as the trio delved into their strategy session. Rocco, the de facto leader, exuded a calm authority, his sharp features set in a mask of concentration. Renato, with his intense gaze and compact frame, was the picture of determination, his input punctuated by decisive gestures. Rosario, the more reserved of the three, contributed with thoughtful observations, his analytical mind dissecting each aspect of their plan.

The conversation ebbed and flowed, a strategic dance of ideas and counterarguments as they plotted their next moves. The air was thick with ambition and the underlying risk of their ventures, the weight of their decisions hanging palpably in the room. Every so often, a burst of laughter or a heated exchange would break the tension, only for the focus to return with renewed intensity.

"Rocco, it's crucial Tony buys into this Marlboro scheme, thinking they're illicit. It's a key condition of your deal with the DA for your cooperation with the ATF," Renato emphasized.

Rocco, understanding the gravity, dialed Tony again. "Tony, we've got a new product line we'd like you to manage. Meet us at our warehouse tomorrow at 10."

"Sure, send me the details," Tony agreed.

Outside, the estate remained a picture of tranquility, the setting sun casting a soft, amber light that played across the facade and the surrounding gardens. The occasional sound of distant traffic or the rustle of leaves in the gentle evening breeze served as a subtle reminder of the world beyond their secluded enclave.

As night fell, the strategy session continued, the glow from the table lamps and the soft ambient lighting creating an island of illumination in the otherwise dimly lit room. The stakes were high, and each man understood the importance of the decisions being made within these walls. In the quiet luxury of Rocco's residence, amidst the opulence and the carefully curated beauty of Coral Gables, a plan was taking shape, one that would further entangle them in the intricate web of their ambitions and schemes.
