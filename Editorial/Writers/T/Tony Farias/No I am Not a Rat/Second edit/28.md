# Chapter 28
The air in Fat Marcus's office was heavy with the unspoken, the thick tension of the impending trial hanging over them like a specter. Tony Sicily, ever the fighter, entered with a resolve that belied the undercurrents of betrayal that had already set the stage for his defense's undoing. Unaware of the clandestine meetings and deals that had been struck at his expense, Tony was focused on the mechanics of his defense and the preservation of his integrity.

"Tony, there's a plea deal on the table from Arsenal. Plead guilty, and he'll push for a lighter sentence, but you'd need to testify against Valerio," Marcus delivered the offer with a practiced neutrality, watching Tony closely for his reaction. This was a test, not just of Tony's resolve but of Marcus's ability to navigate the delicate dance of lawyerly obligations and personal gain.

"And your response to that was...?" Tony's question was loaded, a test in its own right. He expected Marcus, his longtime confidant and defender, to have rejected the offer outright, standing firm in the face of prosecutorial pressure.

"I'm obligated to present you with any offers from the prosecution," Marcus replied, a reminder of the legal formalities that governed their interactions, yet a veiled admission of his failure to dismiss the offer outright.

"Then make it clear to him â€” I'm no informant," Tony declared, his voice firm, leaving no room for ambiguity. His refusal to play the role of informant was a line drawn in the sand, a testament to his principles in the face of adversity. "What's the status on our trial prep? Are the subpoenas for Rocco and Rosario in motion?" Tony pressed on, eager to shift the focus to the tangible aspects of their defense strategy.

"Yes, we're on track. Everything will be set for the trial," Marcus reassured him, his words attempting to project confidence. Yet, beneath the surface, his assurance lacked the solidity that Tony yearned for, a veneer of certainty masking the duplicity that lay beneath.

As Tony departed from Marcus's office, he remained ensconced in his bubble of ignorance, his focus on the trial ahead and the battle for his innocence. Marcus, left alone in the wake of their meeting, reclined in his chair, a sense of satisfaction enveloping him as he contemplated his role in the unfolding drama. His machinations with Arsenal and the promises made to Rocco and Rosario weighed heavily on the scales of justice, tipping them away from Tony's favor.

Later, in the quiet of their home, Tony shared his misgivings with Angelina, his trusted confidante and partner. His instincts, honed through years of navigating the murky waters of business and legal entanglements, sensed a shift in Marcus's loyalty. Angelina, ever the voice of reason and support, sought to allay his fears. "He's been in our corner for decades, Tony. Trust that he'll come through," she counseled, her words meant to bolster his spirits and anchor him to the trust that had defined their relationship with Marcus over the years.

Yet, as the night deepened and the shadows grew longer, Tony's unease persisted, a gnawing sense of betrayal that refused to be quieted. The bond that had once seemed unbreakable now appeared fragile, vulnerable to the machinations of those he had trusted most. The trial loomed large on the horizon, a battleground where truth and deception would collide, with Tony's fate hanging precariously in the balance.
