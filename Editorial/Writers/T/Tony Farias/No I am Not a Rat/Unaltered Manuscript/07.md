Chapter VII

October 2003

Rocco and Rosario were inspecting a shipment of unstamped premium cigarettes. They were planning to ship them to a retailer in Pensacola, Florida, without the state stamp. It had been over a year now[A3] , and they were able to falsify invoices and put the tax money in their pockets.

Rocco was in the middle of the warehouse, giving instruction to Billy, who was driving the forklift, when several unmarked black cars suddenly pulled up to the loading dock. Uniformed and non-uniformed law enforcement officers charged up the ramp, pulling their guns out and screaming, “Don’t move! Hands up! You are under arrest!”

“Hey what’s going on? Do you have a warrant?” Rocco asked.

“Yes, we do,” a non-uniformed detective said.

“Who are you with?”

“The ATF, state division.”

“What’s the charge?” Rosario asked.

“There are several felony counts, including possession of unstamped cigarettes without a license.”

“I need to make a phone call,” Rocco said.

“You will, after we book you. Let’s go.”
