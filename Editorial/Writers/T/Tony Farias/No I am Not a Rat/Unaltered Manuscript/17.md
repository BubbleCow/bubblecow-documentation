Marcus e tu![A7] 

Fat Marcus was sitting at his desk, thinking that he could probably make a lot more money off Tony’s case. He called Lydia, Rocco’s wife.

“Lydia, how are you? I need to come over and meet with Rocco and Rosario regarding this Tony Sicily case.”

“Marcus, I am fine. Why don’t you come over Thursday morning, around ten?” Lydia said.

“I will be there, thanks.”

From the overstuffed sofa in Rocco’s mansion in Coral Gables, Fat Marcus told Rocco and Rosario everything about Tony’s case. “He has copies of cashier’s checks he claims he gave you, Rocco, and that were deposited in a company owned by Rosario. He wants me to subpoena you and Rosario to appear at the trial. It will be embarrassing.”

“Marcus, you’ve known me and Rosario for a long time,” Rocco said. “We cannot allow ourselves to be embarrassed by this guy. We will give you forty thousand cash if you throw Tony under the bus.”

Marcus smiled and extended his hand to Rocco. “Consider it done,” Fat Marcus said.
