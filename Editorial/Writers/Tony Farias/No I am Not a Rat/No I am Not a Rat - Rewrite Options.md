## Option 1 - Light Changes

Tony Sicily's alarm went off at 6:00 a.m., ushered in by the symphony of birds in his backyard. He had recently set up a series of bird feeders, attracting woodpeckers to the palm trees and cardinals and blue jays with their songs. Even the colorful miniature parrots added to the cacophony. It had become a paradise for birds.

His business dealings with Rocco, especially those involving Marlboro Cigarettes, had proven quite profitable. Rocco, with his well-defined abs, often reminded Tony of the gym. At fifty-five, he still maintained the look of a man in his mid-forties.

Beside him, Angelina slept amidst a burst of colorful pillows. The silky sheets had fallen to the floor, revealing her naked form. At thirty-seven, her Mediterranean skin glowed, complemented by long black hair, captivating black eyes, and the grace of a dancer - a testament to her early ballet training.

After his shower, filled with the aromatic scent of bath gel, Tony shaved, then dressed in fresh boxers, linen shorts, a polo shirt, and brown Sperry top-siders. He ran his fingers through his hair and splashed on some cologne.

"Angelina, are you up?" he called out.

Her eyes fluttered open. "Yes, where are you going?"

"I have an early meeting with Rocco at the office. I'll grab coffee at Versailles," he replied.

"What time is it?" she inquired.

"Almost eight."

"God, I need to hurry! My Zumba class starts at nine."

She leaped out of bed and hurried to the bathroom, pausing to flash a smile at Tony. "Tonight," she whispered.

As Tony headed to the garage, the puppy's barking was drowned out by the sound of the buzzer. Peering through the window, he saw several black cars and uniformed agents with Uzi-type submachine guns, some masked and donned in bullet-proof vests, surrounding his BMW.

Frowning, he demanded through the intercom, "What's happening?"

"This is the ATF," an agent responded. "Open the door."

"Do you have a warrant?" Tony challenged as he opened the door.

"Tony Sicily, you're under arrest. We have a warrant from a federal grand jury."

"You're joking. What's the charge?" he asked.

"We'll discuss it at headquarters."

"Are you charging me with a crime?"

"Yes," the agent confirmed.

"Then no discussion without my lawyer."

Angelina, in her white velour robe, her hair wrapped in a towel, burst into the room. Seeing the masked agents, she screamed.

"Tony, what's happening?" she cried out.

An agent, taller than average, gun ready, addressed her, "It's okay, Se√±ora. Come closer."

Tony, handcuffed, shielded her. "That's my wife. If you're firing, it's through me."

"Relax, Tony. We're only here for you," the agent stated.

"Angelina, call Marcus. I've been arrested," Tony instructed. He turned to the officers. "Where are you taking me?"

"To the ATF headquarters in Doral," they answered.

"The ATF?" Angelina queried.

"The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives," an agent explained.
