I am grateful for the opportunity to submit my proposal to become the developmental editor for your book. This chance to contribute to the manuscript's journey from draft to publication is one I deeply value.

With two decades of editorial experience under my belt, I've dedicated my professional life to enhancing the art and craft of storytelling. I've had the honor of editing over 500 books across a diverse spectrum of genres. My approach to developmental editing is all-encompassing, addressing both the macro and micro elements of a manuscript to unlock its maximum potential. I take pride in working closely with authors, whether they are publishing veterans or navigating their first publication, to elevate their work beyond standard industry benchmarks and reader anticipations.

Beyond the editing process, I pride myself on offering a tailored experience that supports authors not just in refining their manuscripts but in navigating the post-edit landscape. My commitment is to provide a bespoke service that caters to the unique needs and aspirations of each writer.

SOMETHING ABOUT THE BOOK

I have attached a sample of my work. Please note, that the author of the book has given written permission for me to use their work as an example.
