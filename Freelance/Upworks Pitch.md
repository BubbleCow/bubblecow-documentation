I am grateful for the opportunity to submit my proposal to become the developmental editor for your book. This chance to contribute to the manuscript's journey from draft to publication is one I deeply value.

With two decades of editorial experience under my belt, I've dedicated my professional life to enhancing the art and craft of storytelling. I've had the honor of editing over 500 books across a diverse spectrum of genres. My approach to developmental editing is all-encompassing, addressing both the macro and micro elements of a manuscript to unlock its maximum potential. I take pride in working closely with authors, whether they are publishing veterans or navigating their first publication, to elevate their work beyond standard industry benchmarks and reader anticipations.

Beyond the editing process, I pride myself on offering a tailored experience that supports authors not just in refining their manuscripts but in navigating the post-edit landscape. My commitment is to provide a bespoke service that caters to the unique needs and aspirations of each writer.

SOMETHIGN ABOUT THE BOOK

I have attached a sample of my work. Please note, that the author of the book has given written permission for me to use their work as an example. 



Your books looks really interesting. I had a look at your website and got a good feel for your genre and potential readership. I started my career as an editor on the Horrible Histories series, and have written book for kids about ancient battles, so also share a passion for all things old and mysterious. 



An integral facet of my editorial philosophy centers on enhancing an author's unique voice rather than altering it. I firmly believe that the essence of a manuscript lies within the distinct style and narrative choices of its author. To this end, I respect and follow the path set by the writer; for instance, adherence to stylistic preferences such as the Oxford comma is maintained unless requested otherwise. My role is to refine and amplify your voice, ensuring that it resonates more clearly and powerfully with your audience.

Understanding that voice is a multifaceted attribute of storytelling, I pay meticulous attention to technical aspects that contribute to its strength and clarity. This includes a focused effort on principles like "show, not tell," which are crucial for immersive storytelling. However, voice comprises many layers beyond a single technique, encompassing narrative pace, character development, and the seamless weaving of themes.

The scope of changes I propose and implement is entirely dependent on the individual needs of each manuscript. Every project is unique, with its own set of challenges and opportunities for enhancement. My approach is tailored to suit the specific requirements of your book, ensuring that the essence of your story is not just preserved but illuminated.

Recognizing the importance of aligning our visions for your manuscript, I am pleased to offer a free sample edit. This allows you to experience firsthand how I can support your work without compromising its integrity or your stylistic choices. It's an opportunity for us to ensure that my editing style is in harmony with your expectations and the needs of your book.
