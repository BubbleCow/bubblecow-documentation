I am grateful for the opportunity to submit my proposal to become the developmental editor for your book. 

With two decades of editorial experience under my belt, I've dedicated my professional life to enhancing the art and craft of storytelling. I've had the honor of editing over 500 books across a diverse spectrum of genres. My approach to developmental editing is all-encompassing, addressing both the macro and micro elements of a manuscript to unlock its maximum potential. I take pride in working closely with authors, whether they are publishing veterans or navigating their first publication, to elevate their work beyond standard industry benchmarks and reader anticipations.

Beyond the editing process, I pride myself on offering a tailored experience that supports authors not just in refining their manuscripts but in navigating the post-edit landscape. My commitment is to provide a bespoke service that caters to the unique needs and aspirations of each writer.

SOMETHING ABOUT THE BOOK

I have attached a sample of my work. Please note, that the author of the book has given written permission for me to use their work as an example.

I am particularly suited to this position since have been deeply involved in the operations of small businesses throughout my career, which has allowed me to cultivate a rich and varied skill set. My experience spans across several sectors, including brewing, pharmaceuticals, education, and publishing. This diverse background has provided me with a unique perspective on the different ways businesses communicate and operate. More importantly, it has given me a deep understanding of the mindset and needs of small business owners. 

I have attached a sample of my work. This is fiction, I didn't have written permission to share any of my non-fiction work. I have, however, provided a copy of a non-fiction ebook I wrote, this has been downloaded over 50,000 times. Please note, that the author of the sample novel has given written permission for me to use their work as an example. This is also a developmental edit with an editor's report, I suspect the approach my be slightly different for your book. 

I am also happy to provide a free sample edit.
