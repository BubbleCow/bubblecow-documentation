<li><a href="https://bubblecow.com/copy-editing">Copy editing</a>.</li>
<li>Beta readers.</li>
<li>Feedback from friends and family.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, in addition to these options, it is also worth considering a <a href="https://bubblecow.com/manuscript-assessment">manuscript assessment service</a>. Manuscript assessments provide the kind of holisitc editorial feedback that will kickstart the writing process.</p>

<h2 id="item-1">What is a Manuscript Assessment?</h2>
<p>While developmental and copy editing provide detailed action-focused feedback, professional manuscript assessment services are designed to give a holistic assessment of what works for a writer, but more importantly, what is not and what needs to be changed. </p>
<p>In other words, a manuscript appraisal, or manuscript assessment, is a paid service (often based on your book's word count) that assesses a piece of creative work, either in part or in full (depending on your budget and needs), and provides feedback.</p> 
<p>It is worth noting that a partial manuscript evaluation comes with some risks. If the editor is unable to see the full scope of your book, it can make an assessment of certain structural issues problematic.</p> 
<p>A manuscript assessment (also known as a critique, appraisal, or structural report) is where a professional editor/assessor reads your manuscript as a whole, paying close attention to your story’s structure, character development, plot development, pace, setting, consistency etc. Manuscript assessments provide a writer with the chance to get professional feedback at an affordable price.</p> 
<p>The editor will provide a written report on what’s working and what needs improvement. Though the focus of the detailed report will differ for each novel, the following elements are an essential focus.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Character.</li>
    <li>Setting.</li>
    <li>Plot.</li>
    <li>Voice.</li>
    <li>Narrative Arc.</li>
    <li>Dialogue.</li>
    <li>Tension.</li>
    <li>Pace.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="item-2">What do you get with a Manuscript Assessment Report?</h2>
<p>The manuscript assessment report is a detailed explanation of the key areas of your book that are both working and not working. It will provide a wide overview of what needs to be changed and what can stay. </p>
<p>In other words, it provides a roadmap for lifting your book to the next level.</p> 
<p>The report will be less detailed than a full developmental edit but will pick up on all of the critical problems and, hopefully, provide solutions.</p> 
<p>Editors will critically assess your book using a set of relevant questions. These will vary from book-to-book, but the list below will provide a good understanding of the editor’s mindset.</p> 

<ul>
    <li>Does the book work?</li>
    <li>Does the book meet the expectations of the genre?</li>
    <li>Does the book meet the expectations of the reader?</li>
    <li>Does the story make sense?</li>
    <li>Does the story hook the reader?</li>
    <li>Is the reader fully engaged? If not, why not?</li>
    <li>Does the story contain plot holes?</li>
    <li>Do areas of the story feel rushed or underdeveloped?</li>
    <li>Are the characters successfully developed?</li>
    <li>Where appropriate, does the story contain sufficient conflict?</li>
    <li>Where appropriate, does the story build narrative tension?</li>
    <li>Does the story fit a suitable narrative structure?</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these questions, an editor will also focus their attention on several broader topics, which include, but are not exclusive to, the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Setting.</li>
    <li>Character.</li>
    <li>Narrative viewpoint (point of view).</li>
    <li>Narrative structure.</li>
    <li>Voice.</li>
    <li>Plot.</li>
   <li>Tropes and cliches.</li>
    <li>Dialogue.</li>
    <li>Movement and pacing. </li>
    <li>Narrative tension.</li>
    <li>Reader engagement. </li>
    <li>Market fit.</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing to note is that a manuscript assessment will not correct sentence-level issues, such as grammar and punctuation. However, if your manuscript contains persistent and significant sentence-level issues, this will be addressed in the report. </p>

<h2 id="item-3">When should you get a manuscript assessment?</h2>
<p>Deciding when the time is right for a manuscript assessment is a personal choice, depending on you and your book. </p>
<p>However, there are several common scenarios in which a professional manuscript appraisal is the best choice. </p>
<p><strong>You are stuck and don’t know what to do next?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine working on the first draft of a novel, but you have come to a grinding halt; perhaps the book has lost momentum, or the structure isn’t working the way you had hoped, or you have just run out of ideas. </p>
<p>At this point, you don’t want to invest in a full developmental edit and just need some guidance to kickstart the writing process; this is when a manuscript assessment is a perfect choice. </p>
<p>An assessment will give you a clear outline of what is working and what you need to do to get the book to the next stage. </p>
<p><strong>You are worried your book is just not good enough</strong>
<p>After investing hours developing your novel, you are now at a stage where you are just not sure that your work is good enough. </p>
<p>You have been focusing on the story for so long that you can’t see the wood for the trees. </p>
<p>This is when an assessment is a great option.</p>
<p>A professional assessment of your work will give you a clear indication of what you are doing right and what’s not working the way you had hoped. The evaluation will provide you with a clear roadmap to what you need to do to lift the book to a publishable standard. </p>
<p><strong>It's the wrong time for a developmental edit</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="https://bubblecow.com/book-editing">professional developmental edit</a> is an essential part of the publication process, but only when the time is right. </p>
<p>If you are confident that your book is close to being publication-ready, it is probably time to invest in a developmental edit.</p>
<p>However, what if you are not that confident your book is ready for the world?</p>
<p>What if you are still at the first draft stage but still want professional feedback?</p>
<p>What if you know there are issues with your story, but you still need some guidance on the best way forward?</p>
<p>In these situations, a full developmental edit is just not the right choice. Instead, a manuscript assessment will give you the feedback you need to push your book to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>You are worried about your book's word count</strong></p>
<p>You are knee-deep in your manuscript and it suddenly dawns on you your book is going to be too long or too short.</p>
<p>You might be writing a novel that is much shorter than you hoped or an epic that's topping out at 150,000 words.</p>
<p>If you are worried about your book's word count, then a manuscript assessment is a perfect solution.</p>
<p>The editor will be able to assess your book and set out a realistic roadmap for the changes you need to make to reach a suitable word count.</p>
<p><strong>Your budget is tight</strong></p>
<p>Let’s not kid ourselves; publishing a book can be an expensive process. Sometimes, you just don’t have the budget to stretch to all the bells and whistles.</p>
<p>While an assessment is not a replacement for a more comprehensive developmental edit, it will provide you with essential feedback at a price that will fit your budget.</p>
<p>So, when the money’s tight, but you still need professional feedback, an assessment might just be the answer.</p>

<h2 id="item-4">Manuscript Assessment Cost</h2>
<p>Before deciding whether a manuscript assessment is worth it, one should consider the cost of such an assessment. The cost of a manuscript assessment can vary depending on several factors, including the length of the manuscript, the level of assessment required, and the expertise of the assessor.</p>
<p>On average, a manuscript assessment can cost anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. Some assessors charge by the word, while others charge by the hour. It is important to do your research and choose an assessor who offers a fair price for the level of service you require.</p>
<p>As you would expect from BubbleCow our pricing is simple and transparent. The price you pay is dependent on the word count of your book. There are no hidden costs.</p>
<p>You can find out the <a href="https://bubblecow.com/manuscript-assessment">manuscript evaluation cost for your book here</a>.</p>
<p>While the cost of a manuscript assessment may seem steep, it is important to keep in mind that it can be a valuable investment in the long run. A manuscript assessment can help identify areas of weakness in your writing and provide feedback on how to improve, ultimately increasing your chances of publication.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that some publishing companies offer manuscript assessments as part of their services. However, these assessments may come at a higher cost as they are often bundled with other editorial services.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about whether a manuscript assessment is worth the cost, consider reaching out to other writers or industry professionals for their opinions. You can also research the track record of the assessor you are considering to ensure that they have a proven history of helping writers improve their work.</p>

    <h3 itemprop="name">What is the difference between manuscript assessment and developmental editing?</h3>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
        <div itemprop="text">
            <p>The key difference between manuscript assessment and developmental editing lies in the depth and scope of the service. Manuscript assessment is an initial, high-level review that provides general feedback on a manuscript's overall potential, identifying major strengths and weaknesses. It's more about giving an overview and broad recommendations rather than detailed edits. Developmental editing, on the other hand, is a more intensive process. It involves a detailed, chapter-by-chapter or even line-by-line analysis of the manuscript. This includes specific suggestions for improvement, such as restructuring, deep character development, and enhancing plot coherence. While manuscript assessment is advisory, developmental editing is hands-on and collaborative, often requiring significant changes to the manuscript.</p>
