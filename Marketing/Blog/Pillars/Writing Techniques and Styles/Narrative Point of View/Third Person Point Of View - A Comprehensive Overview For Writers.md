<p>When writing a novel, you must choose which narrative viewpoint will work best for you and your book.  This choice of narrative point of view is an essential part of any writing journey.</p>

<p>The most common narrative point of view is a third person viewpoint. In third person point of view the narrator refers to all characters with a third person pronouns such as 'he', 'she', or 'they'.</p>

<p>In other words, the narrator is not a story's character but a separate entity.</p> 

<p>In this article, you'll learn about third person point of view. You'll discover the best variety of third person point of view and when to apply third person perspective to your writing.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-narrative-point-of-view">What is Narrative Point of View?</h2>

<p>To fully understand third person point of view, we must first look at narrative viewpoint in general.</p> 

<p>In fact, we must take one step further back and consider narration as a whole.</p>

<p>Wikipedia describes narration as 'the use of a written or spoken commentary to convey a story to an audience'. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative">source</a>]</p>

<p>In other words, it is the way a story is told to the reader.</p>

<p>Narration is split into three elements:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Narrative point of view</strong>: the grammatical person used by the narrator to refer to the character being narrated.</li>
    <li><strong>Narrative tense</strong>: the consistent use of the grammatical tense of either past or present.</li>
    <li><strong>Narrative techniques</strong>: methods of conveying the story.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these three elements, it is narrative point of view that interests us.</p> 

<p>The person who tells a story is known as the narrator; this might be a character in the story, but it might also be a separate 'voice' independent of the other characters.</p> 

<p>The narrative point of view is determined by 'who' tells the story and 'how the story is told'.</p>

<p>There are three different types of narrative view point: <a href="https://bubblecow.com/blog/first-person-viewpoint-a-comprehensive-overview-for-writers-with-examples">first person viewpoint</a>, second person viewpoint and third person viewpoint.</p>

<p>This article looks at first person.</p>

<p>If you would like to learn more about the specifics of all different points of view, this extensive article called <a href="https://bubblecow.com/blog/point-of-view">Mastering Point Of View In Writing: A Comprehensive Guide</a> will prove to be an effective resource.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-third-person-point-of-view"">What is Third Person Point of View?</h2> 

<p>One way to identify your viewpoint is to look carefully at your pronouns. This pronoun will often tell you a lot about the viewpoint.</p>

<p>In third person point of view, the narrator refers to all characters with third-person pronouns such as 'he', 'she', or 'they'.</p>

<p>So 'they' can be considered a third person pronoun.</p>

<p>Remember, the narrator is not a character in the story and is a separate entity, this means they will refer to characters as separate people and not use a pronoun such as 'I"/.</p> 

<p>Third person point of view is, by far, the most common method of storytelling and has been the viewpoint of choice for some of the best-known stories in the English language. Here's the opening from Jane Austen's <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></em> a novel famously written from a third person point of view. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</p>

    <p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>

    <p>"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"</p>

   <p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>

    <p>"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."</p>

    <p>Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>

    <p>"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.</p>

    <p>"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."</p>

    <p>This was invitation enough.</p> 

</blockquote>

<p>One clear distinction of the third person point of view is that the narrator is someone separate from the novel's characters. In fact, the narrator is almost always unidentified. This leads to a third-person narrator often being called an 'anonymous narrator'.</p>

<p>This is very different from a first-person narrator, where the narrator is both identified and a character within the novel.</p> 

<h2 id="historical-evolution">Historical Evolution of Third-Person Point of View</h2>

<p>The origins of the third-person point of view in literature can be traced back to ancient epic tales and classical texts. These early examples often employed a narrative style that was external to the characters, focusing on their actions rather than internal thoughts.</p>

<p>During the Renaissance, the third-person narrative began to evolve, offering deeper character insights. The Romantic and Victorian eras saw further development, with authors like Jane Austen and Charles Dickens using this perspective to explore complex social themes and character psychology. The Modernist movement brought experimental approaches to third-person narration, challenging traditional storytelling methods.</p>

<p>In contemporary literature, the third-person point of view continues to be versatile, adapting to various narrative styles and genres. Recent trends include the blending of third-person with other perspectives and the use of a more intimate, character-focused approach. This evolution reflects the ongoing innovation in storytelling techniques and the diverse ways in which writers engage with their readers.</p>

<h2 id="different-types-of-third-person">Different Types of Third Person Point of View?</h2>

<p>When learning about third person points of view, the most confusing element for new writers is the distinction between the different types of third-person viewpoints. All third person point of view is written using a detached and anonymous narrator, but the information the narrator possesses about the characters differs significantly between different types of viewpoint.</p> 

<p>All third person points of view sit somewhere on an axis between subjective/objective and omniscient/limited. </p>

<p>We look at these in more detail below, but it is essential to understand that all third-person viewpoints will be between subjective and objective and omniscient and limited. In most cases, a viewpoint tends to be either subjective OR objective and omniscient OR limited. This is not always the case. Some narrative stances can move along these axes as the story progresses, but this is uncommon. </p>

<h3>Third-Person Limited POV</h3>
<p>In the <strong>Third-Person Limited POV</strong>, the narrator tells the story from the perspective of one character at a time. This approach provides insight into the thoughts and feelings of the focal character, while other characters are presented externally. It's akin to looking over the shoulder of the protagonist, experiencing the world and events through their eyes. This POV is particularly effective in creating a deep connection with the character while maintaining the authorial distance of third-person narration.</p>

<h3>Third-Person Omniscient POV</h3>
<p>The <strong>Third-Person Omniscient POV</strong> offers a 'godlike' perspective, where the narrator knows everything happening in the story world. This includes access to the thoughts, feelings, and backgrounds of all characters. It allows for a broad and all-encompassing view of the narrative, making it ideal for complex stories with multiple characters and intricate plots. The omniscient POV can provide a comprehensive understanding of the events and motivations behind characters' actions.</p>

<h3>Third-Person Objective POV</h3>
<p>The <strong>Third-Person Objective POV</strong> presents a more detached view. Here, the narrator reports events without delving into the internal thoughts or feelings of any character, akin to a camera recording the unfolding action. This style creates a sense of objectivity and is often used in journalistic writing or stories where the focus is more on events than on characters' internal experiences. It leaves much to the reader's interpretation, as they only witness actions and dialogues without being privy to the characters' internal states.</p>

<h2 id="genre-specific">Genre-Specific Uses of Third-Person Point of View</h2>

<p>The third-person point of view offers unique advantages in various literary genres, each employing this perspective to enhance storytelling in distinct ways. From the expansive worlds of fantasy to the intricate character dynamics in romance, this point of view adapts to the needs of different narratives. Let's explore how the third-person POV is tailored to enrich the reader's experience in key genres like Fantasy and Sci-Fi, Mystery and Thriller, and Romance and Historical Fiction.</p>

<h3>Fantasy and Sci-Fi</h3>
<p>In <strong>Fantasy and Sci-Fi</strong> genres, the third-person point of view is pivotal for world-building and handling complex plotlines. It allows authors to introduce fantastical elements and expansive universes from a perspective that can encompass vast settings and multiple character arcs. The omniscient viewpoint is particularly useful in these genres, providing a godlike view of invented worlds and the intricate interplay of characters within them. For example, George R.R. Martin's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a> series masterfully uses this POV to navigate a complex world with a large cast of characters.</p>

<h3>Mystery and Thriller</h3>
<p>For <strong>Mystery and Thriller</strong> novels, the third-person limited POV is often preferred. It allows readers to follow the protagonist's journey closely, unraveling mysteries and encountering surprises alongside them. This POV can also shift between characters, offering varied perspectives on the unfolding plot and enhancing the suspense. An excellent example of this is Gillian Flynn's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_Girl_(novel)">Gone Girl</a>, where the third-person limited perspective deepens the mystery and complexity of the narrative.</p>

<h3>Romance and Historical Fiction</h3>
<p>In <strong>Romance and Historical Fiction</strong>, the third-person limited POV is frequently used to delve deep into characters' emotions and relationships, while also providing historical context. It balances the intimacy of first-person with the broader scope of third-person, allowing for a detailed exploration of the characters' internal and external worlds. The narrative can switch between the perspectives of different characters, offering a comprehensive view of their emotions and the dynamics of their relationships. A notable example is Jane Austen's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a>, which uses third-person limited POV to explore the nuances of romantic relationships and social dynamics of the era.</p>

<h2 id="flexibility">Flexibility and Adaptability of Third-Person Point of View</h2>

<p>The <strong>third-person point of view</strong> stands out for its remarkable flexibility and adaptability in storytelling. This versatility allows writers to adjust the narrative's lens as needed, seamlessly shifting from an overarching, all-knowing perspective to a more focused, character-specific view. The third-person POV can provide a broad view of the story world and its various inhabitants or zoom in to offer a detailed, intimate portrayal of a single character's experiences and perceptions.</p>

<p>Its adaptability extends to how it can accommodate shifts in tone, perspective, and narrative depth. Writers can choose to narrate events in a straightforward, objective manner or adopt a more subjective approach, delving into the characters' innermost thoughts and feelings. This flexibility makes the third-person POV an excellent choice for a wide range of literary works, from intricate multi-character epics to deeply personal character studies.</p>

<p>Moreover, the third-person perspective can bridge the gap between the immersive, personal experience of the first-person POV and the broader, more inclusive scope of an omniscient narrator. It allows authors to maintain narrative consistency while still providing the freedom to explore the inner workings of their characters' minds or to step back and present events in a more detached, unbiased manner.</p>

<h2 id="comparative-analysis">Comparative Analysis with First and Second Person Narratives</h2>

<p>In the realm of narrative writing, choosing the right point of view (POV) is crucial for shaping the reader's experience. This section offers a <strong>comparative analysis</strong> of the third-person POV against the first and second-person perspectives. Each POV brings its unique flavor to storytelling, influencing the reader's connection with the narrative. Understanding these differences helps writers select the POV that best suits their storytelling goals.</p>

<h3>Comparison with First Person</h3>
<p>Compared to the <strong>first-person POV</strong>, where the story is told directly by a character using "I," the third-person POV provides more narrative flexibility. First-person narration offers an intimate, subjective view of the story, deeply immersing readers in the narrator's personal experiences and emotions. In contrast, third-person narration can offer varying degrees of objectivity and omniscience, enabling a wider view of the story world and multiple characters' perspectives.</p>

<h3>Comparison with Second Person</h3>
<p>The <strong>second-person POV</strong>, which addresses the reader as "you," creates a unique, direct engagement with the narrative, often placing the reader in the protagonist's shoes. This POV is less common and can offer an intense, immersive experience. The third-person POV, by comparison, provides a more traditional storytelling format, allowing readers to observe the story from a distance, without the direct involvement implied by second-person narration.</p>

<h3>Balancing Perspective</h3>
<p>Choosing between first, second, and third-person POVs depends on the desired narrative impact. The third-person POV strikes a balance between the intimate connection of first-person and the immersive directive of second-person. It can be tailored to either bring readers closer to the characters' inner worlds or provide a panoramic view of the story, making it a versatile tool for storytellers to achieve their desired narrative effect.</p>

<h2 id="item-4">Subjective and Objective Narrative Point of View</h2>

<p>Third person point of view subjective narration involves a narrator with access to one or more character's personal feelings and thoughts. In other words, the narrator understands the thoughts and feelings of, at least, one character. </p>

<p>This is a common type of storytelling. The narrator typically focuses on one character (though not always), who is the main character.</p>

<p>A great example of Third-person subjective narration is Hemingway's <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea">The Old Man and the Sea</a></em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.</p> 
</blockquote>

<p>Third person point of view objective narration sees the narrator not describing the feelings or thoughts of any characters but, rather, just the exact facts of the story.</p> 

<p>The narrator tends to be very 'de-humanized' and detached from the story. This approach is often called "fly-on-the-wall" or "camera lens", since the narrator will describe events and actions but provide no explanation or character thoughts.</p> 

<p>This type of viewpoint was popular in the 19th century with large, sweeping narratives. It is also occasionally called 'over the shoulder' narration. It sees the focus with one character and the narrator describing only the events perceived and information known by this character.</p> 

<p>This approach is very similar to first-person, but produces a narrower and more claustrophobic version of the third person viewpoint.</p> 

<p>Perhaps the most famous example of this type of third person viewpoint is <em><a href="https://faculty.weber.edu/jyoung/English%202500/Readings%20for%20English%202500/Hills%20Like%20White%20Elephants.pdf">Hills Like White Elephants</a></em> by Ernest Hemingway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hills across the valley of the Ebro' were long and white. On this side there was no shade and no trees and the station was between two lines of rails in the sun. Close against the side of the station there was the warm shadow  of  the  building  and  a  curtain,  made  of  strings  of  bamboo  beads,  hung across the open door into the bar, to keep out flies. The American and the girl with him sat at a table in the shade, outside the building. It was very hot  and  the  express  from  Barcelona  would  come  in  forty  minutes.  It stopped at this junction for two minutes and went on to Madrid.</p>


   <p>"What should we drink?" the girl asked. She had taken off her hat and put it on the table.</p>

    <p>"It's pretty hot," the man said.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="item-5">Omniscient and Limited Narrative Points of View</h2>
<p>Third person omniscient point of view is an approach that sees the narrator knowing everything that is happening within the story's world, including what each of the characters is thinking and feeling.</p> 

<p>This viewpoint stance is very common and is used by some of the most famous writers, including Charles Dickens. It is the approach that works best when looking to produce complicated plots with deep, complex characters. One major drawback is that it is impossible to create an unreliable narrator since the reader has access to events, thoughts, and feelings throughout the world.</p>

<p>Below is the opening to Charles Dickens' <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities">A Tale of Two Cities</a></em>, an example of third person omniscient point of view.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Third person limited point of view sees the narrator conveying the knowledge and subjective experience of just one character. In other words, the narrator is focussed on a single character and only knows this character. </p>

<p>This is a very common narrative approach and is, perhaps, the most common storytelling format for popular novels in the Twentieth Century. One of the most successful uses of First-person limited narration is J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.</p> 

<p>The example below is taken from Jack London's <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Build_a_Fire">To Build a Fire</a></em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Day had dawned cold and gray when the man turned aside from the main Yukon trail. He climbed the high earth-bank where a little-traveled trail led east through the pine for- est. It was a high bank, and he paused to breathe at the top. He excused the act to himself by looking at his watch. It was nine o'clock in the morning. There was no sun or promise of sun, although there was not a cloud in the sky. It was a clear day. However, there seemed to be an indescribable darkness over the face of things. That was because the sun was absent from the sky. This fact did not worry the man. He was not alarmed by the lack of sun. It had been days since he had seen the sun." </p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="item-6">Advantages and Disadvantages of Third Person Point of View</h2>
<p>Third person point of view offers several advantages and disadvantages to writers that should be considered when choosing the narrative voice for their work. Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of this point of view can help writers make the best decision for their particular story. Here are some of the key advantages and disadvantages of third person point of view:</p>
<h3>Advantages:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>Multiple perspectives: Third person point of view allows for the narrative to switch between different characters' perspectives, giving the reader a more well-rounded understanding of the events and emotions of the story. This can be particularly useful for complex stories with multiple protagonists or for exploring different sides of a conflict.</p></li>
  <li><p>Objectivity: Third person point of view creates a more neutral and objective tone, allowing the reader to form their own opinions and judgments about the events and characters in the story. This can be especially important in writing that deals with controversial or sensitive subjects.</p></li>
  <li><p>Distance: Third person point of view can provide a sense of distance between the narrator and the events of the story, making it easier for the reader to step back and analyze what is happening without being overly emotionally invested. This can be useful for conveying a more detached or analytical perspective.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>Limited emotional connection: One of the main drawbacks of third person point of view is that it can be more difficult for the reader to form an emotional connection with the characters and events in the story. This can result in a less immersive and impactful reading experience.</p></li>
  <li><p>Conveying inner thoughts and feelings: Another challenge with third person point of view is conveying the inner thoughts and feelings of the characters. In order to do this, the writer must use indirect methods such as dialogue, actions, and descriptions, which can be less effective than showing the reader directly what the characters are thinking and feeling.</p></li>
  <li><p>Limited intimacy: Third person point of view can also create a sense of distance between the reader and the story, making it harder for the reader to become fully immersed in the world of the story. This can limit the intimacy and emotional impact of the writing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, third person point of view can be a powerful tool for writers, but it is important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages carefully when making the decision to use it. Understanding the strengths and limitations of third person point of view can help writers make the best choice for their story and create the most effective narrative voice for their work.</p>

<h2 id="comparative-view">Comparative View with First and Second Person POVs</h2>

<p>Understanding the distinctions between first, second, and third-person points of view is essential for writers aiming to choose the best narrative style for their story. This section provides a comparative view, highlighting how each POV uniquely shapes the narrative and influences the reader's experience.</p>

<p>The <strong>first-person POV</strong> offers a deep, personal insight into the narrator's mind, creating an intimate bond with the reader. The <strong>second-person POV</strong>, though less common, directly addresses the reader, often creating an immersive, interactive experience. The <strong>third-person POV</strong>, with its varying degrees of knowledge and objectivity, provides a more flexible and encompassing narrative tool. It allows writers to move seamlessly between the subjective experiences of characters and an objective, broader view of the story world.</p>

<p>Each POV has its strengths and is suited to different types of stories and narrative techniques. The choice depends on the story’s requirements and the experience the writer wishes to convey to the reader.</p>
