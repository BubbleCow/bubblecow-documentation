<p>Writing dialogue in fiction enriches narratives, bringing characters and their stories to life. Formatting dialogue involves understanding punctuation, indentations, and how to attribute speech correctly, ensuring clarity and flow. Writing good dialogue means crafting conversations that are authentic, character-driven, and serve the plot, avoiding exposition-heavy or unnatural speech. The seven rules of writing dialogue include keeping it concise and relevant, using it to reveal character and advance the plot, ensuring it sounds believable, differentiating characters' voices, avoiding unnecessary tags, and incorporating subtext and conflict. These guidelines help create engaging and realistic interactions that captivate readers.</p>
