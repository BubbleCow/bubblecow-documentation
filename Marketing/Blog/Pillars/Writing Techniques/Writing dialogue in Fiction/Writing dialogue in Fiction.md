Include dialogue tags, such as 'he replied' or 'she whispered', to attribute speech and convey tone. Balance dialogue with action or descriptive text for context.

<p>Writing good dialogue in fiction involves crafting conversations that sound natural yet serve the story. Key is to ensure each character's voice is distinct and reflects their personality and background. Dialogue should reveal character traits, advance the plot, and create tension or humor as needed. Avoid exposition-heavy lines; instead, let characters speak as they naturally would, with interruptions, contractions, and colloquialisms. Good dialogue often lies in what's unsaid; subtlety and implication can be powerful tools.</p>
