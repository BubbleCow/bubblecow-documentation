## Pages
Pages are split into Main Content (MC), Supplementary Content (SC) and adverts. 
### Main Content (MC)
Main Content is any part of the page that directly helps the page achieve its purpose. MC can be text, images, videos, page features (e.g., calculators, games), and it can be content created by website users, such as videos, reviews, articles, comments posted by users, etc. Tabs on some pages lead to even more information (e.g., customer reviews) and can
 sometimes be considered part of the MC. 

The MC should be:

- Surrounded by the `<main><main>` tag.
- It should use the h1 tag for the tile. 
- The title should be descriptive:
	- News website homepage: the purpose is to inform users about recent or important events. MC - News Homepage
	- News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. MC - News Article
	- Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product.
	- Blog post page: the purpose is to share music used on a TV show. MC - Blog Post Page
### Supplementary Content (SC)
 Supplementary Content contributes to a good user experience on the page, but does not directly help the page achieve its purpose. SC is an important part of the user experience. One common type of SC is navigation links that allow users to visit other parts of the website. In some cases, content behind tabs may be considered part of the SC. 

The SC should:

- Use the correct indicators such as `<navbar></navbar` or `<aside></aside>`

## Website
Google views the website as a whole.

### Important Pages
Google is expecting to see the following:

- Clear navigation to the home page form other areas in the website.
- A clear indication as to how is responsible for the page or an about page.
