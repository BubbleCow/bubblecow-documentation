> This is thoughts and feelings on how to build an education element to BubbleCow and prepare it for an AI driven world

## Driving Principles

- AI will transform the way people use the Google. Simple questions will be answered at the point of asking. This means that the traffic to sites will change and be replaced with those looking for products, services or complex answers. 
- AI will make access to knowledge unlimited, therefore the problem is not accessing information as it was in the pre-Internet days, but finding the best, curated information that fits a users needs. We will more from general to bespoke. This means that charging for general or 'best practice' information is pointless, the value is in crafting bespoke solutions. 
- Community will continue to become increasingly valuable. The desire for someone to belong will never alter. An ability to provide an inclusive environment, in which writers feel heard, will be the key for success in the coming years. 
- People will continue to pay for products that solve their problems, however, these products will be to be increasing bespoke to ensure they stand out from the crowd. AI will allow customers to gain basic knowledge and assistance. A successful company will do more than this.

## Message

- This is the message Rebecca Barr is presenting. I don't fully agree but she knows her market and there is certainly some value here:
	- Have your vision brought to life, create a legacy, and be supported every step of the way.
	- Fun, activating and inspiring experience.
	- Write in a community of like minded people. 
	- Create an impact and income based on gifts. 
	- Eliminate procrastination and overwhelm. Follow step-by-step to teach you everything you need to know. 
	- Ensure your hard work pays off. 




- This is a long term 'movement' funded by a paid course. 
- It should have its own brand. 
- It should have a set of principles, it is an opinionated way to publish a book
	- Write in plain text.
	- Create books for readers not readers for book.
	- Create remarkable books.
	- Don't play by the publishers rules, you will lose.

Seacrow/bubblecow community
- discord 
- what's app group chat
- - SeaCrow podcast

- Free interactive BubbleCow course with a paid element. This would be more about building a community. I need to make people **feel** like writers.  This would be short and simple with a low and high level paid element. Start with one course and build. The paid interaction would need to be able to scale. This would also be aimed at younger writers. It needs to feel like a community with a real shared mindset, need to make sure this is correct - unheard voice? We could use ethos such as write in plain text and ignore format. Write for 1000 readers. Focus on niche. Can't beat the big boys so do something different,  find your tribe and write the books for them. I am creating a tribe. Stop trying to write bestsellers and break the 'code', write quality books your readers will love. You art is in your ideas, technology only helps. Plain text and tools.
	- The free element includes the written material and access to a weekly 'call'. 
	- The paid element would include:
		- A VIP discord.
		- Access  to all recorded calls and material. 
		- Mastermind group
		- ChatGPTs
			- Writing GPT
			- Character name GPT
			- Agent GPT
