> This is thoughts and feelings on how to build an education element to BubbleCow and prepare it for an AI driven world

## Driving Principles

- AI will transform the way people use the Google. Simple questions will be answered at the point of asking. This means that the traffic to sites will change and be replaced with those looking for products, services or complex answers. 
- AI will make access to knowledge unlimited, therefore the problem is not accessing information as it was in the pre-Internet days, but finding the best, curated information that fits a users needs. We will more from general to bespoke. This means that charging for general or 'best practice' information is pointless, the value is in crafting bespoke solutions. 
- Community will continue to become increasingly valuable. The desire for someone to belong will never alter. An ability to provide an inclusive environment, in which writers feel heard, will be the key for success in the coming years. 
- People will continue to pay for products that solve their problems, however, these products will be to be increasing bespoke to ensure they stand out from the crowd. AI will allow customers to gain basic knowledge and assistance. A successful company will do more than this. 


## Digital First Ideology
This is the opinionated view behind concept of digital first publishing:

- Write in plain text.
- Create books for readers not readers for book.
- Create remarkable books.
- Don't play by the publishers rules, you will lose.

**Plain Text**
It is all too easy to get caught up in using the 'latest' or 'best' software. This is a trap. When you write using software from a third party, you are tried into their format. In order to future-proof your writing is it always best to write in plain text, this is a format that will always be accessible. It is also advised that you use markdown. 

**Text and Publishing Separated**
It is important to think about text and the way it is delivered to the reader as separate. The text of the book should be written in plain text and act as a 'master'. This master text can then be converted into multiple formats depending on the way it will be consumed. For example, the text might be converted to PDF for printing but ePub for digital. The styling of this text with contextual to the delivery system and often different for different formats. 

**Reader Driven Writing**

- Free interactive BubbleCow course with a paid element. This would be more about building a community. I need to make people **feel** like writers.  This would be short and simple with a low and high level paid element. Start with one course and build. The paid interaction would need to be able to scale. This would also be aimed at younger writers. It needs to feel like a community with a real shared mindset, need to make sure this is correct - unheard voice? We could use ethos such as write in plain text and ignore format. Write for 1000 readers. Focus on niche. Can't beat the big boys so do something different,  find your tribe and write the books for them. I am creating a tribe. Stop trying to write bestsellers and break the 'code', write quality books your readers will love. You art is in your ideas, technology only helps. Plain text and tools.
	- The free element includes the written material and access to a weekly 'call'. 
	- The paid element would include:
