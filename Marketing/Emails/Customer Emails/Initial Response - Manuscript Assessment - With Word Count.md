Hi.

Thank you for reaching out. I am excited to hear about your book and the opportunity to work with you to bring it to publication.

(TEXT)

So getting the nitty gritty out of the way...

The cost for editing your manuscript would be XXX. This price is a flat fee based on word count and is all-inclusive.


Every writer’s requirements are different, but I wanted to say upfront that we have a detailed outline of what the service covers here: https://bubblecow.com/manuscript-assessment and https://bubblecow.com/terms-and-conditions

  
I have attached a sample from an actual report to better illustrate the process. This is provided with the writer’s permission.


We can also provide a non-disclosure agreement if you feel this concerns you. 

  
Anyway, with all that out of the way, if you have any questions or would like to discuss further before proceeding, please let us know, and I would be happy to arrange a chat.

Let me know if you have any questions, and we can begin the process.
