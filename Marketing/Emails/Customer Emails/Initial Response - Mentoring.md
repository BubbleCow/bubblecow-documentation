**Consider rewriting this...**

I know I am probably stating the obvious here, but writing a book is hard. 

  

Coming up with an idea good enough to be worthy of your time is difficult enough, but to then be able to do that idea justice by finding the right words is often overwhelming. 

  

No one wants to spend months, or even years, writing a book only to find it's just not good enough.

  

The reality is that we all need help. 

  

The key to success in any walk of life is to surround yourself with a team of people who lift you and help you to be the best you can be.

  

Writing is no different. 

  

BubbleCow has been helping authors write better books since 2007. Up until today, that help has taken the form of developmental editing. 

  

Well, that’s a little white lie. 

  

Yes, we have always provided developmental editing, but in addition, behind the scenes, we’ve worked with writers on a more intimate one-to-one mentorship basis, but this has always been an informal and ad hoc arrangement. Only being offered occasionally, and only when it was the best possible solution for a writer and their book.

  

We’ve decided to change this. 

  

Since lockdown, we have had an increasing number of requests for help from writers. These writers have started projects and realize that they need help. They feel overwhelmed and unsure of how to lift their book to a publishable standard. They don't want to wait until their book is finished and employ a professional editor, they need more immediate and intensive help. 

  

So, from today, we are opening up the mentoring. 

  

We have created a detailed outline of the service on our website, which you can find by following the link at the bottom of this email. 

  

In short, we have created a service that is cost-effective (we are BubbleCow after all) and designed with writers in mind. 

  

We want to offer mentoring that is both beneficial to authors and doesn't force you into a long-term and expensive contract, more suited to the mentor than the writer. 

  

We want to provide mentoring that fits your needs. 

  

This means that it must be cost-effective, easy to use, and highly impactful.

  

The way it works is simple. 

  

You submit your book in chunks (up to 15,000 words), and only pay for feedback and mentoring for that chunk of your book. No hidden costs or long-term commitments. 

  

Then, once you have your feedback, have spoken to your mentor, and are ready to move forward, you submit your next chunk. 

  

And so on... 

  

No contract, no long-term financial commitment. One chunk at a time.

  

You just pay for what you need, when you need it. 

  

Sound too good to be true? Well, there's one word of warning. 

  

We don’t have many places available. This is a new service and at this point, we can only space with a limited number of writers. So it's first come, first served.

  

If you are interested, there’s a form on the mentoring page. Just click the link below and fill out the form. To get started we just need to know a little about yourself and your book. Once we have this information we will get back to you to discuss the best way to move forward.
